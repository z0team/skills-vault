/**
 * Regression test for #2384.
 *
 * During execute-phase, the orchestrator merges per-plan worktree branches into
 * main. The pre-merge deletion check (git diff --diff-filter=D HEAD...WT_BRANCH)
 * only catches files deleted on the worktree branch. A post-merge audit is also
 * required to catch deletions that made it into the merge commit (e.g., files
 * that were in the common ancestor but deleted by the merged worktree) and to
 * provide a revert safety net.
 *
 * After #3797: execute-phase.md delegates worktree cleanup to the SDK's
 * worktree.cleanup-wave command, which implements pre-merge deletion checks
 * (diff --diff-filter=D) internally via executeWorktreeWaveCleanupPlan.
 * The manual post-merge shell audit (MERGE_DEL_COUNT, git reset --hard) has
 * been removed from the workflow — it was part of the SDK-absence fallback.
