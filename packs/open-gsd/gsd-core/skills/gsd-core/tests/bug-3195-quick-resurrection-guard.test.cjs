/**
 * Drift-guard for bug #3195: quick.md and execute-phase.md must both use
 * the same resurrection-detection approach so they stay in sync.
 *
 * After #3797: both workflows delegate worktree cleanup to the SDK's
 * worktree.cleanup-wave command, which implements resurrection detection
 * (diff --diff-filter=D history checks) internally. The inline WAS_DELETED
 * shell variable form has been removed from both workflows — it was part of
 * the SDK-absence fallback which is now dead code since preflight exits if
 * neither local nor global SDK is available.
 *
 * This test ensures both workflows continue to use the same cleanup
 * mechanism (SDK delegation), not one inline and one delegated.
