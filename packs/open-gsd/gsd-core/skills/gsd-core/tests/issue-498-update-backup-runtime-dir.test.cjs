/**
 * Regression (#498, adversarial-review finding): the custom-file backup step in
 * update.md must derive RUNTIME_DIR from GSD_DIR.
 *
 * The get_installed_version step was rewritten to call `gsd-tools update-context`
 * and now emits GSD_DIR (the resolved config dir) instead of the old probe-loop
 * variables LOCAL_DIR / GLOBAL_DIR. The backup_custom_files step still read
 * LOCAL_DIR / GLOBAL_DIR, which are no longer assigned anywhere — so RUNTIME_DIR
 * went empty for every LOCAL/GLOBAL install and detect-custom-files was skipped.
 * Because the update then runs a clean install that wipes managed dirs
 * (commands/gsd, gsd-core), user-added files inside those dirs could be
 * deleted without the intended backup.
 *
 * This locks the fix: RUNTIME_DIR comes from GSD_DIR, and the dead LOCAL_DIR /
 * GLOBAL_DIR references are gone.
 *
 * Source-text-is-the-product: update.md's bash blocks ARE the deployed /gsd:update
 * program; asserting their shape is asserting on the deployed contract.
