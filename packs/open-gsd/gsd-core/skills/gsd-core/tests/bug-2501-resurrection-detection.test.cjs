/**
 * Tests for bug #2501: resurrection-detection block in execute-phase.md must
 * check git history before deleting new .planning/ files.
 *
 * Root cause: the original logic deleted ANY .planning/ file that was absent
 * from PRE_MERGE_FILES, which includes brand-new files (e.g. SUMMARY.md)
 * that the executor just created. A true "resurrection" is a file that was
 * previously tracked on main, deliberately deleted, and then re-introduced by
 * a worktree merge. Detecting that requires a git history check, not just a
 * pre-merge tree membership check.
 *
 * After #3797: execute-phase.md delegates worktree cleanup to the SDK's
 * worktree.cleanup-wave command. Resurrection detection is handled internally
 * by the SDK. The inline WAS_DELETED shell check has been removed from the
 * workflow — it was part of the SDK-absence fallback which is no longer needed
 * since the preflight block exits if neither local nor global SDK is available.
