/**
 * Execute-phase worktree shared artifact ownership tests
 *
 * Guards against bug #1571: worktree executor agents independently writing
 * STATE.md and ROADMAP.md, causing last-merge-wins overwrites.
 *
 * Fix: In parallel worktree mode, remove STATE.md/ROADMAP.md update requirements
 * from the executor agent success_criteria. The orchestrator owns those writes
 * after each wave via single-writer post-wave commands.
