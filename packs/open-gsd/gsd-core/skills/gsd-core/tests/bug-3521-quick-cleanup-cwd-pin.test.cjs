// quick.md is the shipped orchestration contract for /gsd-quick; this
// regression test previously locked the CWD-safety guard in the manual shell
// cleanup loop. After #3797, quick.md delegates cleanup entirely to the SDK's
// worktree.cleanup-wave command, which encapsulates CWD-pinning, STATE.md/
// ROADMAP.md backup/restore, and deletion guards internally.
//
// This test file now verifies the delegation contract: quick.md calls
// worktree.cleanup-wave with || exit 1 (fail-closed), which enforces the
// safety semantics that were previously implemented inline in the shell loop.
