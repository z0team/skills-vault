/**
 * Regression tests for #2838: SUMMARY rescue silently fails when .planning/
 * is gitignored.
 *
 * After #3797: execute-phase.md and quick.md delegate worktree cleanup to the
 * SDK's worktree.cleanup-wave command. The SDK's executeWorktreeWaveCleanupPlan
 * handles SUMMARY rescue internally using a filesystem-level find+cp approach
 * (bypassing gitignore) rather than the old git ls-files --exclude-standard
 * form that silently dropped gitignored files.
 *
 * The inline "Safety net" shell rescue block that was previously in both
 * workflow files has been removed — it was part of the SDK-absence fallback
 * which is now dead code since preflight exits if neither local nor global SDK
 * is available.
 *
 * This test file verifies that both workflows correctly delegate to the SDK
 * for SUMMARY rescue, and that neither workflow retains the broken inline form.
