/**
 * Regression test for bug #2506
 *
 * /gsd-settings presents Quality/Balanced/Budget model profiles without any
 * warning that on non-Claude runtimes (Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) these profiles
 * select Claude model tiers and have no effect on actual agent model selection.
 *
 * Fix: settings.md must include a non-Claude runtime note instructing users to
 * use "Inherit" or configure model_overrides manually, and the Inherit option
 * description must explicitly call out non-Claude runtimes.
 *
 * Closes: #2506
