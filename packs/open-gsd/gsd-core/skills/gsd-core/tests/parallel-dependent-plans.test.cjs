/**
 * Tests for bug #1587: parallel agents for dependent plans
 *
 * Validates that:
 * 1. gsd-planner.md assign_waves step explicitly checks files_modified overlap
 *    and mandates a later wave for any plan that shares files with a prior plan.
 * 2. execute-phase.md has a pre-spawn intra-wave files_modified overlap check
 *    and directs sequential execution when overlap is detected.
