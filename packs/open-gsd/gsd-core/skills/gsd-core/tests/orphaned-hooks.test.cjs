 * Regression test for #1750: orphaned hook files from removed features
 * (e.g., gsd-intel-*.js) should NOT be flagged as stale by gsd-check-update.js.
 *
 * The stale hooks scanner should only check hooks that are part of the current
 * distribution, not every gsd-*.js file in the hooks directory.
 *
 * Migration note (#455): previously used fs.readFileSync + regex on the worker
 * and build-hooks source to extract arrays. Now imports typed exports directly:
 *   - hooks/managed-hooks-registry.cjs  → MANAGED_HOOKS
 *   - scripts/build-hooks.js            → HOOKS_TO_COPY
