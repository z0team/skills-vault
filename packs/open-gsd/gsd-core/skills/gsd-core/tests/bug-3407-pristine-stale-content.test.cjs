/**
 * Bug #3407: Installer leaves stale content in gsd-pristine/
 *
 * Root cause: populatePristineDir() in saveLocalPatches() snapshots from
 * pristineCtx.packageSrc — the NEWLY-downloaded release tree — and writes
 * those bytes into gsd-pristine/.  For files changed between the old and new
 * release, this writes the NEW bytes into the pristine baseline instead of
 * the OLD bytes.  The three-way-diff verifier then classifies upstream-changed
 * lines as user-added → Step 5a gate fails with false FAIL_USER_LINES_MISSING.
 *
 * The #3657 fix (OK_PRISTINE_DRIFT_DETECTED) was a symptom workaround: the
 * verifier detects hash mismatch (backup-meta.json records old-release hash
 * but gsd-pristine/ has new-release bytes) and skips to over-broad mode
 * instead of false-failing.  The root-cause stale write was never fixed.
 *
 * Fix: when a correctly-populated gsd-pristine/ already exists from the
 * previous install (i.e., the file's sha256 matches the originalHash recorded
 * in the manifest), preserve it — do NOT wipe and re-populate from the new
 * release source.  This ensures gsd-pristine/ holds old-release bytes even
 * after an upgrade where the file content changed upstream.
 *
 * Regression contract (byte-comparison):
 *   After saveLocalPatches() is called with a user-modified file whose
 *   gsd-pristine/ entry was correctly set by the previous install, the
 *   gsd-pristine/ file MUST still contain the old-release bytes, not the
 *   new-release bytes supplied in pristineCtx.packageSrc.
 *
 * Closes: #3407
