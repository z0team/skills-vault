// Issue #57 — Runtime Install No-Drift Tests.
//
// Protects the Runtime Install Policy Module boundary (ADR-58) and the explicit
// Runtime Config Adapter Registry (#60) now that the policy boundary (#58),
// explicit adapter registry (#60), and legacy directory-helper retirement (#56)
// have landed. These guards FAIL when:
//
//   (AC1) supported-runtime metadata is added to an installer/query call site
//         without going through the runtime registry projection, or
//   (AC2) config-mutation dispatch bypasses the explicit adapter registry.
//
// (AC3) Assertions are behavioral (require + reflect on live exports) wherever
// behavior can cover the contract; the two source-text assertions are structural
// guards that behavioral checks cannot replace, and are annotated per repo
// convention. (AC4) The existing installer / runtime-policy / runtime-global-skills
// suites must stay green — verified by running them alongside this file, not
// asserted here.
//
// Known INTENTIONAL asymmetries — these are not drift; do not "fix" them by
// tightening the invariants:
//   - `grok` appears in runtime-homes.cjs's getGlobalConfigDir switch but NOT in
//     the registry / artifact-layout supported sets (it resolves a config-dir home
//     but is not an installable artifact target). So runtime-homes' full switch set
//     is never tied into the equality invariant — it is only probed forward, per
//     installable runtime.
//   - getGlobalConfigDir() falls back to ~/.claude for an UNKNOWN runtime instead
//     of throwing (a deliberately liberal projection). Only the registry and
//     artifact-layout projections are loud gates, so only those are asserted to
//     throw on an unknown runtime.
//
// Coverage boundary (deliberate, see #57 follow-up): the structural guard below
// catches a NEW inline `runtime === '...'` branch against an UNREGISTERED runtime.
// It cannot catch a duplicate inline config write added for an ALREADY-registered
// runtime — distinguishing that from the ~169 legitimate per-runtime comparisons in
// the installer requires driving install()/finishInstall() against a mocked
// filesystem and asserting the written surfaces match resolveRuntimeConfigIntent().
// That behavioral install-driver harness is out of scope for this no-drift pass.
//
// The forward invariant `allRuntimes ⊆ artifact-layout` is already covered by
// tests/install-runtime-artifacts.test.cjs; this file does not duplicate it.
