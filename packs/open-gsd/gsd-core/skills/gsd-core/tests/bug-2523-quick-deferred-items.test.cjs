/**
 * Regression test for bug #2523
 *
 * workflows/quick.md Step 8 ("Build file list") listed PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md,
 * STATE.md, and mode-conditional CONTEXT.md / RESEARCH.md / VERIFICATION.md —
 * but omitted deferred-items.md. When an executor logs out-of-scope findings
 * to ${QUICK_DIR}/${quick_id}-deferred-items.md during task execution, that
 * file was left untracked after the final commit even with commit_docs: true.
 *
 * Fix: add a file-existence-gated entry for deferred-items.md to Step 8.
