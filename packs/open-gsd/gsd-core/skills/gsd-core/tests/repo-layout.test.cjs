/**
 * Governance tests for the gsd-core repository root layout.
 *
 * Invariant: the repository root must not contain ad-hoc AI instruction files
 * (such as AGENTS.md) that would become an untracked source of truth running
 * in parallel with the canonical CONTEXT.md and docs/adr/ records.
 *
 * Context: bin/install.js (local Copilot install path, issue #786) writes an
 * AGENTS.md to process.cwd() when `gsd install copilot` is run inside a repo
 * checkout. If that file is ever committed, editors and AI tools that auto-load
 * repo-root instruction files will silently pick up GSD's installer-generated
 * stub rather than the authoritative documentation. This test ensures that
 * artefact never lands in source control.
