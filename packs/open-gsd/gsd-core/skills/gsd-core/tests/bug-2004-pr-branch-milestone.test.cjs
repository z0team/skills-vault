/**
 * Regression tests for bug #2004
 *
 * /gsd-pr-branch must not exclude milestone archive and structural planning
 * commits. The previous implementation filtered ALL .planning/-only commits,
 * including STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, MILESTONES.md, and milestones/** updates
 * that are needed to preserve repository planning state after a merge.
 *
 * Fixed: pr-branch.md now distinguishes:
 *   - Transient planning commits (phase plans, summaries, research, context) → EXCLUDE
 *   - Structural planning commits (STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, MILESTONES.md,
 *     PROJECT.md, milestones/**) → INCLUDE
 *   - Code commits (any non-.planning/ file) → INCLUDE
 *   - Mixed commits (code + planning) → INCLUDE
