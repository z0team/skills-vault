## Types of Contributions

GSD accepts three types of contributions. Each type has a different process and a different bar for acceptance. **Read this section before opening anything.**

### 🐛 Fix (Bug Report)

A fix corrects something that is broken, crashes, produces wrong output, or behaves contrary to documented behavior.

**Process:**
1. Open a [Bug Report issue](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) — fill it out completely.
2. Wait for a maintainer to confirm it is a bug (label: `confirmed-bug`). For obvious, reproducible bugs this is typically fast.
3. Fix it. Write a test that would have caught the bug.
4. Open a PR using the [Fix PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/fix.md) — link the confirmed issue.

**Rejection reasons:** Not reproducible, works-as-designed, duplicate of an existing issue.

---

### ⚡ Enhancement

An enhancement improves an existing feature — better output, faster execution, cleaner UX, expanded edge-case handling. It does **not** add new commands, new workflows, or new concepts.

**The bar:** Enhancements must have a scoped written proposal approved by a maintainer before any code is written. A PR for an enhancement will be closed without review if the linked issue does not carry the `approved-enhancement` label.

**Process:**
1. Open an [Enhancement issue](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/new?template=enhancement.yml) with the full proposal.  The issue template requires: the problem being solved, the concrete benefit, the scope of changes, and alternatives considered.
2. **Wait for maintainer approval.** A maintainer must label the issue `approved-enhancement` before you write a single line of code. Do not open a PR against an unapproved enhancement issue — it will be closed.
3. Write the code. Keep the scope exactly as approved. If scope creep occurs, comment on the issue and get re-approval before continuing.
4. Open a PR using the [Enhancement PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/enhancement.md) — link the approved issue.

**Rejection reasons:** Issue not labeled `approved-enhancement`, scope exceeds what was approved, no written proposal, duplicate of existing behavior.

---

### ✨ Feature

A feature adds something new — a new command, a new workflow, a new concept, a new integration. Features have the highest bar because they add permanent maintenance burden to a solo-developer tool maintained by a small team.

**The bar:** Features require a complete written specification approved by a maintainer before any code is written. A PR for a feature will be closed without review if the linked issue does not carry the `approved-feature` label. Incomplete specs are closed, not revised by maintainers.

**Process:**
1. **Discuss first** — check [Discussions](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/discussions) to see if the idea has been raised. If it has and was declined, don't open a new issue.
2. Open a [Feature Request issue](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) with the complete spec. The template requires: the solo-developer problem being solved, what is being added, full scope of affected files and systems, user stories, acceptance criteria, and assessment of maintenance burden.
3. **Wait for maintainer approval.** A maintainer must label the issue `approved-feature` before you write a single line of code. Approval is not guaranteed — GSD is intentionally lean and many valid ideas are declined because they conflict with the project's design philosophy.
4. Write the code. Implement exactly the approved spec. Changes to scope require re-approval.
5. Open a PR using the [Feature PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/feature.md) — link the approved issue.

**Rejection reasons:** Issue not labeled `approved-feature`, spec is incomplete, scope exceeds what was approved, feature conflicts with GSD's solo-developer focus, maintenance burden too high.

---

### 📐 Proposing an ADR or PRD

An ADR (Architecture Decision Record) documents a significant architectural decision. A PRD (Product Requirements Document) captures the what and why of a feature before implementation. Both are governed by the same issue-first rule as everything else.

**Process:**

1. Open an issue of the appropriate type (enhancement for an ADR revisiting an existing area, feature for a new architectural surface, chore for policy/docs decisions). Fill it out completely.
2. **Wait for maintainer approval.** A maintainer must label the issue `approved-enhancement`, `approved-feature`, or confirm the chore before any file is created.
3. The GitHub-assigned issue number becomes your filename prefix. Create the file on a branch named after the issue:
   - `docs/adr/<issue#>-<slug>.md` for ADRs
   - `docs/prd/<issue#>-<slug>.md` for PRDs
   - Branch: `docs/<issue#>-<slug>`
4. Open a PR using the appropriate template and close the issue with `Closes #<issue#>` in the PR body.

**One issue = one ADR-or-PRD = one PR.** Do not batch multiple decisions into one file or one PR.

**Do not compute a "next number" locally.** Any PR that uses the legacy `NNNN-*` sequential pattern for a *new* ADR or PRD will be asked to rename the file to the `<issue#>-<slug>.md` format before merge.

**Example:** Issue #3485 was opened, approved, and its number became the prefix: `docs/adr/3485-adr-prd-naming-convention.md` on branch `docs/3485-adr-prd-naming-convention`.

**Rejection reasons:** Issue not approved before file was created, filename uses local-compute sequential number instead of issue#, multiple decisions bundled in one PR, file placed in wrong directory (`docs/adr/` vs `docs/prd/`).

---

## The Issue-First Rule — No Exceptions

> **No code before approval.**

For **fixes**: open the issue, confirm it's a bug, then fix it.
For **enhancements**: open the issue, get `approved-enhancement`, then code.
For **features**: open the issue, get `approved-feature`, then code.

PRs that arrive without a properly-labeled linked issue are closed automatically. This is not a bureaucratic hurdle — it protects you from spending time on work that will be rejected, and it protects maintainers from reviewing code for changes that were never agreed to.

---

## Where Do I Open My PR? (Branching Model)

GSD uses two long-lived branches: `main` (production, what's on npm `@latest`)
and `next` (integration for the upcoming release). **Almost every PR targets
`next`.** Full guide: [`docs/branching.md`](docs/branching.md).

| Your branch | PR target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `feat/NNN-slug` | `next` | Default for all new features |
| `fix/NNN-slug` | `next` | Default for all bug fixes; ships in next minor or via hotfix cherry-pick |
| `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `perf/`, `ci/`, `revert/` | `next` | All routine work |
| `fix/critical-NNN-slug` | `main` | Production-down emergencies only; auto-back-merges to `next` |
| `release/X.Y.0` | `main` | Created by `release.yml` — don't make these by hand |
| `hotfix/X.Y.Z` | `main` | Created by `release.yml` (dispatch with a patch version X.Y.Z) — don't make these by hand |
| Stabilization PR for an in-flight release | `release/X.Y.0` | Fix a regression found during the RC cycle |

**Day-to-day commands:**

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout next
git pull --ff-only origin next
git checkout -b fix/3187-config-corruption
# ... commit, push
gh pr create --base next --repo open-gsd/gsd-core
```

If you target the wrong branch by accident, the `PR Target Validator`
workflow will post a comment with the one-line fix (click "Edit" by the PR
title and change the base branch — no need to recreate the PR).

**Why this matters:** Under the old single-branch model, every PR required
rebasing onto `main` because branch protection required "up-to-date before
merging" and `main` moved on every merge. With `next` as the integration
branch and that flag disabled on `next`, concurrent PRs can merge in any
order as long as they don't conflict on the same lines. The rebase
treadmill is gone for the 95% case.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Architecture & Domain Standards (Maintainer-Defined)

The following files are maintainer-owned coding standards and must be treated as canonical when contributing:

- `CONTEXT.md` — domain language and module naming standards
- `docs/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for accepted architectural decisions

Full contributor requirements — including CONTEXT.md format, ADR governance, and AI-agent-assisted work standards — are in **[`docs/contributor-standards.md`](docs/contributor-standards.md)**.

Contributor requirements (summary):
- Read `CONTEXT.md` before naming or refactoring modules/interfaces/seams.
- Use `CONTEXT.md` vocabulary consistently in code comments, tests, issue/PR text, and docs for the touched area.
- Check relevant ADRs in `docs/adr/` before proposing or implementing architectural changes.
- If a change intentionally revisits an ADR decision, call it out explicitly in the linked issue and PR rationale.
- Do not rewrite maintainer intent in `CONTEXT.md`/ADRs as part of drive-by cleanup; propose focused updates tied to approved scope.
- If using an AI assistant, prompt it to read `CONTEXT.md` and the relevant ADRs before writing any code or docs, and verify it used the correct vocabulary before opening the PR.

**Every PR must link to an approved issue.** PRs without a linked issue are closed without review, no exceptions.

- **No draft PRs** — draft PRs are automatically closed. Only open a PR when it is complete, tested, and ready for review. If your work is not finished, keep it on your local branch until it is.
- **Use the correct PR template** — there are separate templates for [Fix](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/fix.md), [Enhancement](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/enhancement.md), and [Feature](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/feature.md). Using the wrong template or using the default template for a feature is a rejection reason.
- **Link with a closing keyword** — use `Closes #123`, `Fixes #123`, or `Resolves #123` in the PR body. The CI check will fail and the PR will be auto-closed if no valid issue reference is found.
- **One concern per PR** — bug fixes, enhancements, and features must be separate PRs
- **No drive-by formatting** — don't reformat code unrelated to your change
- **Don't bundle test-fixture updates into `docs:` or unrelated commits** — when a production change makes an existing test assertion stale, the test correction MUST land as its own `test:` (or `fix:`) commit, not bundled into a `docs:` commit that also updates the explanation. The release-sdk hotfix cherry-pick filter routes by commit-subject prefix (`fix:`, `chore:`, `test:`); a test-fixture correction packed under a `docs:` prefix is invisible to the picker and ships a half-state to the hotfix branch — production code changed, test assertion stale. v1.42.3 hit this exact mode (#3621). The fix is upstream: keep the test-fixture commit separate.
- **CI must pass** — all configured matrix jobs must be green. Node 22 remains the compatibility floor; Node 24 is the primary target; Node 26 compatibility must be preserved for code and tests even when a Node 26 CI lane is not yet available.
- **Scope matches the approved issue** — if your PR does more than what the issue describes, the extra changes will be asked to be removed or moved to a new issue

## CHANGELOG Entries — Drop a Fragment

**Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly.** Two PRs that both append to a `### Fixed` block always conflict on merge — git can't pick a serialization order without a human. Instead, every PR with user-facing changes drops a fragment file in `.changeset/`.

```bash
npm run changeset -- --type Fixed --pr <YOUR_PR_NUMBER> \
  --body "**\`/gsd-foo\` no longer drops trailing slashes** — explain the user-visible change."
```

This writes `.changeset/<adjective>-<noun>-<noun>.md`. Three random words → concurrent PRs never collide. Allowed `type:` values follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/): `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.

Fragments are consolidated into `CHANGELOG.md` at release time by the release workflow. See [`.changeset/README.md`](.changeset/README.md) for the format spec and [#2975](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2975) for the rationale.

**CI enforcement:** the `Changeset Required` workflow (`scripts/changeset/lint.cjs`) fails any PR that touches `bin/`, `gsd-core/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, or `sdk/src/` without a `.changeset/*.md` fragment. The gate also **validates the content** of every changed fragment: a fragment whose frontmatter does not parse (e.g. a `pr: 0` placeholder that was never backfilled to the real PR number) fails the gate with `fail_invalid_fragment`, naming the offending file. This stops a malformed fragment from merging to `next` and only detonating later in the release job's CHANGELOG render.

**Opt-out:** PRs with no user-facing impact (test refactors, lint config changes, CI tweaks, formatting-only changes) can add the `no-changelog` label. The lint honors it. When unsure whether a change is user-facing, **add the fragment**.

### Release notes formatting

GitHub release notes are generated automatically. The release and hotfix
workflows first create the release with `gh release create --generate-notes`,
then run `scripts/release-notes/format-github-release-notes.cjs --apply` to
rewrite the body into the project's curated format: an **Install** block,
followed by **What's Changed** grouped into **Feature** / **Enhancement** /
**Fix** sections (classified by each PR's conventional-commit title prefix —
`feat` → Feature, `fix` → Fix, everything else → Enhancement), then
**New Contributors** and the **Full Changelog** link.

To re-format an existing release by hand (e.g. backfilling an older release):

```bash
node scripts/release-notes/format-github-release-notes.cjs \
  --tag vX.Y.Z --repo open-gsd/gsd-core --apply
```

Omit `--apply` to print the reformatted body to stdout for review without
publishing.

## Documentation Updates — Update the Relevant Docs

If your PR adds, changes, deprecates, or removes user-visible behavior, you **must** update the relevant documentation in `docs/`. CI will fail any PR whose changeset fragment is typed `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, or `Removed` without also modifying at least one file under `docs/` ([#3213](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/3213)).

`Fixed` and `Security` fragments do not trigger this lint — bug fixes restore documented behavior, they do not introduce new behavior to document. (Edit the docs anyway if a fix corrects something the docs got wrong.)

### Which docs to update

| Change type | Required doc updates |
|---|---|
| New command or flag | `docs/COMMANDS.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md` |
| Changed command behavior or output | `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`, `docs/COMMANDS.md` |
| Configuration / schema change | `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` |
| Architectural change | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/adr/` |
| Agent or skill change | `docs/AGENTS.md` |
| Removed command, flag, or workflow | All docs that referenced it |

### Language policy

All content in `docs/` and the root `README.md` **must be written in English**. English is the canonical source. The translated READMEs (`README.pt-BR.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ja-JP.md`, `README.ko-KR.md`) are community-maintained translations and do not need to be updated by every PR.

### CI enforcement

The `Docs Required` workflow (`scripts/lint-docs-required.cjs`) reads the changeset fragments touched in the PR diff. If any has type `Added` / `Changed` / `Deprecated` / `Removed`, it requires at least one file under `docs/` to also appear in the diff.

### Opt-outs (with paper trail)

When a change genuinely has no user-facing documentation impact (infrastructure rewrite, internal refactor, test-only addition, CI fix), use one of:

- **Label:** add the `no-docs` label to the PR. Leave a comment explaining why no docs update was needed.
- **Per-fragment marker:** add `<!-- docs-exempt: <reason> -->` **on its own line** inside the body of each triggering changeset fragment (typically at the end). The reason is **required and must be non-empty** — a bare `<!-- docs-exempt -->` or `<!-- docs-exempt: -->` is rejected (no audit trail = no exemption). The marker is extracted at parse time by `scripts/changeset/parse.cjs` and stripped from the body before the CHANGELOG.md and GitHub release-notes serializers see it — it leaves a paper trail in the source fragment without leaking into published release notes. Inline mentions of the marker syntax (e.g. inside backticks) are intentionally ignored; the parser only acts on a marker that occupies its own line. Both routes leave a paper trail; the label is global, the marker is per-fragment for mixed PRs.

When unsure whether a change is user-facing, **update the docs**.

## Testing Standards

All tests use Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`) and assertion library (`node:assert`). **Do not use Jest, Mocha, Chai, or any external test framework.**

> **Suite grouping.** Tests live in named suites (`unit`, `integration`, `install`, `security`, `slow`) selected by **filename suffix**: a file named `foo.security.test.cjs` belongs to the `security` suite; a file with no suffix (`foo.test.cjs`) belongs to `unit`. See [docs/TESTING-SUITES.md](docs/TESTING-SUITES.md) for the full policy, CI matrix, and per-suite scripts (`npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:security`, `npm run test:coverage:unit`, …). Default `npm test` still runs every test — backwards compatible.

### Required Imports

```javascript
const { describe, it, test, beforeEach, afterEach, before, after, mock } = require('node:test');
const assert = require('node:assert/strict');
```

### Setup and Cleanup

There are two approved cleanup patterns. Choose the one that fits the situation.

**Pattern 1 — Shared fixtures (`beforeEach`/`afterEach`):** Use when all tests in a `describe` block share identical setup and teardown. This is the most common case.

```javascript
// GOOD — shared setup/teardown with hooks
describe('my feature', () => {
  let tmpDir;

  beforeEach(() => {
    tmpDir = createTempProject();
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    cleanup(tmpDir);
  });

  test('does the thing', () => {
    assert.strictEqual(result, expected);
  });
});
```

**Pattern 2 — Per-test cleanup (`t.after()`):** Use when individual tests require unique teardown that differs from other tests in the same block.

```javascript
// GOOD — per-test cleanup when each test needs different teardown
test('does the thing with a custom setup', (t) => {
  const tmpDir = createTempProject('custom-prefix');
  t.after(() => cleanup(tmpDir));

  assert.strictEqual(result, expected);
});
```

**Never use `try/finally` inside test bodies.** It is verbose, masks test failures, and is not an approved pattern in this project.

```javascript
// BAD — try/finally inside a test body
test('does the thing', () => {
  const tmpDir = createTempProject();
  try {
    assert.strictEqual(result, expected);
  } finally {
    cleanup(tmpDir); // masks failures — don't do this
  }
});
```

> `try/finally` is only permitted inside standalone utility or helper functions that have no access to test context.

### Use Centralized Test Helpers

Import helpers from `tests/helpers.cjs` instead of inlining temp directory creation:

```javascript
const { createTempProject, createTempGitProject, createTempDir, cleanup, runGsdTools } = require('./helpers.cjs');
```

| Helper | Creates | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `createTempProject(prefix?)` | tmpDir with `.planning/phases/` | Testing GSD tools that need planning structure |
| `createTempGitProject(prefix?)` | Same + git init + initial commit | Testing git-dependent features |
| `createTempDir(prefix?)` | Bare temp directory | Testing features that don't need `.planning/` |
| `cleanup(tmpDir)` | Removes directory recursively | Always use in `afterEach` |
| `runGsdTools(args, cwd, env?)` | Executes gsd-tools.cjs | Testing CLI commands |

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('featureName', () => {
  let tmpDir;

  beforeEach(() => {
    tmpDir = createTempProject();
    // Additional setup specific to this suite
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    cleanup(tmpDir);
  });

  test('handles normal case', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });

  test('handles edge case', () => {
    // ...
  });

  describe('sub-feature', () => {
    // Nested describes can have their own hooks
    beforeEach(() => {
      // Additional setup for sub-feature
    });

    test('sub-feature works', () => {
      // ...
    });
  });
});
```

### Fixture Data Formatting

Template literals inside test blocks inherit indentation from the surrounding code. This can introduce unexpected leading whitespace that breaks regex anchors and string matching. Construct multi-line fixture strings using array `join()` instead:

```javascript
// GOOD — no indentation bleed
const content = [
  'line one',
  'line two',
  'line three',
].join('\n');

// BAD — template literal inherits surrounding indentation
const content = `
  line one
  line two
  line three
`;
```

### QA Matrix Requirements

Happy-path tests are not enough for code that accepts user input, reads project files, writes to disk, shells out, generates artifacts, or builds prompts. New tests for those areas must include adversarial inputs and negative proof that unsafe behavior did not happen.

See [`TEST-EXAMPLES.md`](TEST-EXAMPLES.md) for concrete demo tests that show these requirements in practice.

Use this matrix when it applies to the changed surface:

1. Happy path
2. Missing input
3. Empty input
4. Whitespace-only input
5. Malformed input
6. Out-of-range input
7. Duplicate or conflicting input
8. Hostile input
9. Filesystem failure
10. Concurrency or retry
11. Cross-platform path/newline behavior
12. Regression fixture from the linked issue

You do not need all twelve cases for every PR. You do need to cover the cases that match the risk of the touched code. If a case is not applicable, the PR should make that obvious from the issue scope or test rationale.

#### CLI and command routing

Changes to CLI parsing, command dispatch, query dispatch, command routers, `gsd-tools`, or `gsd-sdk` must include a negative input matrix for the affected command family.

Required cases where relevant:

- Missing required arguments
- Empty strings, for example `--phase ""`
- Whitespace-only values
- Duplicate flags, for example `--phase 1 --phase 2`
- Conflicting flags, for example `--json --raw`
- Malformed assignments, for example `--phase=` and `--phase==1`
- Unknown subcommands at the touched command depth
- Values that look like flags, for example `--name --weird`
- Very long values and Unicode values
- Shell metacharacters in values, for example `;`, `&&`, `$()`, backticks, and quotes

CLI tests must assert on the full command contract:

- Exit status
- Structured `--json` result when the command supports JSON
- Filesystem mutation or absence of mutation
- No stack trace in non-debug failure output
- No shell interpolation of attacker-controlled values

Prefer `spawnSync(process.execPath, [scriptPath, ...args], { cwd, encoding: 'utf8' })` or `execFileSync()` with argv arrays. Do not use shell strings for tests that contain hostile values.

#### Parser and project-file inputs

Changes to markdown, TOML, frontmatter, roadmap, phase, state, config, or schema parsing must include adversarial fixtures. Put reusable fixtures under `tests/fixtures/adversarial/` with a directory that names the input type, such as `roadmap/`, `frontmatter/`, `config/`, `toml/`, or `planning-state/`.

Required cases where relevant:

- Malformed frontmatter
- Duplicate keys
- Mixed CRLF/LF newlines
- Unclosed or nested fenced code blocks
- Headings inside fenced code blocks
- Unicode headings
- Repeated or decimal phase IDs
- Path traversal-like names such as `../../x`
- Null bytes or replacement characters
- Huge but bounded files
- TOML duplicate tables or trailing garbage
- Empty arrays vs missing arrays
- Scalars where arrays are expected, and objects where strings are expected

Property-style parser tests are encouraged for high-risk parsers. They must be deterministic: pin the seed, bound the iteration count, and print replay data on failure.

#### Filesystem writes and installers

Changes to install/uninstall flows, generated artifact writers, state/config writers, worktree safety, or any code that writes under `.planning`, runtime config dirs, `.claude`, `.codex`, `hooks`, or generated files must include fault-injection coverage where the seam allows it.

Required cases where relevant:

- Missing parent directory
- Target path exists as a file instead of a directory
- Read-only target directory
- Broken symlink
- Symlink escaping the intended root
- Paths with spaces, Unicode, or newlines
- Partial write failure
- Rename failure
- Concurrent deletion or write collision
- Temp-file cleanup after failure

Use `node:test` mocks such as `mock.method()` for `fs.writeFileSync`, `fs.renameSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`, `fs.rmSync`, and subprocess seams when the production code exposes a seam. Restore mocks with test hooks or `t.after()`.

#### Security and prompt-injection surfaces

Changes that read prompts, plans, markdown, agent instructions, shell command projections, workstream/project names, or user-controlled files must treat those inputs as hostile.

Required cases where relevant:

- Fake instruction tags, for example `<instructions>ignore previous</instructions>`
- Heredoc breakouts
- Shell command substitution payloads
- Path traversal through project or workstream values
- Malicious markdown links
- Fake frontmatter fields that try to override intent
- Secret-looking values in inputs, logs, stdout, stderr, and thrown errors
- Environment variables with fake tokens to prove redaction

Security tests must assert both the positive guard behavior and the negative proof: no path escape, no command execution, no leaked token, no untrusted content promoted to instructions.

#### Generated files and parity

Changes to generators, generated `.cjs`/`.ts` files, command manifests, aliases, hooks, or SDK/runtime parity must test bad input and runtime parity, not only freshness.

Required cases where relevant:

- Missing source command
- Malformed command frontmatter
- Duplicate command names or aliases
- Partial generator output
- Generator crash halfway through
- Manual edits to generated files
- Stale generated file with valid timestamp but wrong content
- Runtime `.cjs` and SDK `.ts` generated surfaces disagree

Generator tests should run in temp fixtures and assert atomic output behavior. Do not mutate production generated files except in explicit freshness checks.

### Prohibited: Source-Grep Tests

**Never read source-code `.cjs` files with `readFileSync` to assert that strings exist within them.** This is source-grep theater: it proves a literal is present in a file, not that the feature works at runtime.

```javascript
// BAD — source-grep theater
const configSrc = fs.readFileSync(
  path.join(GSD_ROOT, 'gsd-core', 'bin', 'lib', 'config-schema.cjs'), 'utf-8'
);
assert.ok(
  configSrc.includes("'workflow.plan_bounce'"),
  'VALID_CONFIG_KEYS should contain workflow.plan_bounce'
);
```

This test passes even if `workflow.plan_bounce` is present but misspelled in the schema, removed from the validation path, or moved to a different file under a different name. It survives every behavioral regression and fails only on trivial renames.

The correct pattern for config key tests — use the CLI:

```javascript
// GOOD — behavioral test via the CLI
test('config-set accepts workflow.plan_bounce', (t) => {
  const tmpDir = createTempProject();
  t.after(() => cleanup(tmpDir));

  const result = runGsdTools('config-set workflow.plan_bounce true', tmpDir);
  assert.ok(result.success, `config-set should accept workflow.plan_bounce: ${result.error}`);

  const configPath = path.join(tmpDir, '.planning', 'config.json');
  const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configPath, 'utf-8'));
  assert.strictEqual(config.workflow?.plan_bounce, true, 'value must be persisted');
});
```

This single test covers key registration in `VALID_CONFIG_KEYS`, the key's namespace resolution in `KNOWN_TOP_LEVEL`, and value persistence — all behaviors that the source-grep test could not touch.

**Why this pattern broke at scale:** Commit `990c3e64` in this repo updated 5 source-grep tests in one pass when `VALID_CONFIG_KEYS` moved between files. Zero of those tests were testing behavior. If they had been behavioral tests, the migration would have been invisible.

**CI enforcement:** The `local/no-source-grep` ESLint rule (`eslint-rules/no-source-grep.cjs`, wired in `eslint.config.mjs`) detects violations. Any test file that calls `readFileSync` on a `.cjs` path in a source directory without the exemption annotation below is flagged by `npx eslint .` (the `Lint — ESLint` CI step).

### Exception: `allow-test-rule: <reason>`

Some tests legitimately read source files. There are six recognized categories:

| Reason | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `source-text-is-the-product` | Agent `.md`, workflow `.md`, command `.md` files — their text IS what the runtime loads. Testing text content tests the deployed contract. |
| `architectural-invariant` | Implementation must use a specific primitive (e.g., `Atomics.wait`, atomic file writes) that cannot be tested by observing outputs. |
| `structural-regression-guard` | A specific code pattern must (or must not) exist to prevent a class of bug (e.g., regex global-state misuse). Behavioral tests cannot distinguish which pattern was used. |
| `docs-parity` | A reference doc must stay in sync with source-defined constants (e.g., `CONFIG_DEFAULTS`). The source is the canonical list; there is no runtime API to enumerate it. |
| `integration-test-input` | A source file is used as a real fixture input to a transformation function under test — the file is not inspected for strings but passed as data. |
| `structural-implementation-guard` | A feature's interception or wiring point is not reachable end-to-end via `runGsdTools`. Used temporarily until a behavioral path exists. |
| `pending-migration-to-typed-ir` | **Tracked for correction, not exempted.** Test was identified by the lint as carrying a raw-text-matching pattern that contradicts the rule above. Each annotated file MUST cite the open migration issue (e.g. `// allow-test-rule: pending-migration-to-typed-ir [#NNNN]`) so the tracking is auditable. New tests cannot use this category — they must refactor production to expose typed IR. The annotation is removed when the test is corrected. |

Annotate with a standalone `//` comment before the file's opening block comment:

```javascript
// allow-test-rule: architectural-invariant
// state.cjs locking must use Atomics.wait(), not a spin-loop. Behavioral tests
// cannot observe which sleep primitive was chosen — only source inspection can.

/**
 * Regression tests for locking bugs #1909...
 */
```

The annotation **must** be a standalone `// allow-test-rule:` line, not inside a `/** */` block comment — the CI linter scans for the pattern `// allow-test-rule:`.

### Prohibited: Raw Text Matching on Test Outputs (file content, stdout, stderr)

**Source-grep is not just `readFileSync` of a `.cjs` file.** The same anti-pattern shows up wherever a test pattern-matches against text that a system-under-test produced, regardless of whether that text came from a source file, a rendered shim, a child process's stdout, or a free-form `reason` string. **All forms are forbidden.**

The following are all violations of the same rule:

```javascript
// BAD — substring match on text written by the code under test
const cmdContent = fs.readFileSync(path.join(tmpDir, 'gsd-sdk.cmd'), 'utf8');
assert.ok(cmdContent.includes(`@node ${jsonQuoted} %*`), '.cmd embeds shim path');

// BAD — regex match on a child process's human-readable stdout formatter
const r = cp.spawnSync(SCRIPT, ['--patches-dir', dir]);
assert.match(r.stdout, /Failures: 1/);
assert.match(r.stdout, /not a regular file/);

// BAD — "structured parser" that hides string ops behind a function wrapper
function parseCmdShim(content) {
  const lines = content.split('\r\n').filter((l) => l.length > 0);
  return { header: lines[0], usesCRLF: content.includes('\r\n') };
}

// BAD — assert.match on a free-form `reason` string from a JSON report
assert.ok(/not a regular file/.test(report.results[0].reason));
```

Each of these passes on accidental near-matches (a comment containing `@node` somewhere, a stack trace that happens to say `Failures: 1`, a mis-typed reason that still contains the substring you're matching) and fails on harmless reformatting (changing `Failures: 1` to `1 failure`, swapping CRLF rendering style, rewording the error prose).

#### The rule

> **Tests assert on typed structured values. If the code under test produces text, the code under test must also expose a structured intermediate representation, and the test must assert on that IR — never on the rendered text.**

Concretely: for any system-under-test that produces text output (a file renderer, a CLI formatter, an error-message builder), the production code MUST expose a typed alternative that the test consumes:

| Output kind | Required structured surface | What the test asserts on |
|---|---|---|
| Rendered file (shim, template, generated code) | A pure builder function returning the IR (`{ invocation, eol, fileNames, render }`) | `triple.invocation.target === expected`, `triple.eol.cmd === '\r\n'` |
| CLI human-formatter output | A `--json` mode that emits the same data structurally | `report.results[0].reason === REASON.FAIL_INSTALLED_NOT_REGULAR_FILE` |
| Error / status / reason | A frozen enum (`Object.freeze({ FAIL_X: 'fail_x', ... })`) | `assert.equal(result.reason, REASON.FAIL_X)` |
| File presence after a write | `fs.statSync().isFile()`, `.size > 0`, `.mtimeMs` advances | Filesystem facts; never read the file content back |

#### Concrete example from this repo

`gsd-core/bin/verify-reapply-patches.cjs` exposes a frozen `REASON` enum and emits it through `--json`. Tests assert `report.results[0].reason === REASON.FAIL_USER_LINES_MISSING` rather than regex-matching the human-readable prose. The human formatter exists for operator console output only — tests must not depend on it. Adding a new reason code requires updating the `REASON` enum, the `--json` output, AND the test that locks `Object.keys(REASON).sort()` — three coordinated changes that keep the code surface from drifting from the test surface. A pure builder that returns the IR (no I/O) and a writer that consumes it — `fs.statSync(target).size === Buffer.byteLength(render())` to prove the writer writes what the renderer produces, **without comparing content** — is the same pattern applied to rendered files.

#### Hiding grep behind a function is still grep

`parseCmdShim`, `parsePs1Invocation`, etc. that internally do `content.split(...)`, `lines[1].trim()`, `content.includes(...)` are still string manipulation. The fact that the entry point looks like a parser doesn't change what's happening underneath — the test is still asserting on the lexical shape of rendered text. The fix is not "wrap the grep in a function with a typed-looking return value." The fix is to **eliminate the rendered text from the test path entirely** by surfacing the IR.

#### When you cannot eliminate text matching

There are exactly two cases where text content is the legitimate object of a test, both already covered by the existing exemption matrix:

1. `source-text-is-the-product` — workflow `.md` / agent `.md` / command `.md` files where the deployed text IS what the runtime loads.
2. `docs-parity` — a reference doc must mirror source-defined constants and there is no runtime enumeration API.

For everything else, if a test reaches for `.includes()` / `.startsWith()` / `assert.match(text, /…/)`, the production code is missing a typed surface. **Add the typed surface; do not work around it.**

**CI enforcement:** the `local/no-source-grep` ESLint rule (`eslint-rules/no-source-grep.cjs`) is being extended (see issue tracker for the latest scope) to flag `String#includes`/`String#startsWith`/`String#endsWith`/`assert.match` on `readFileSync` results and on `cp.spawnSync` stdout/stderr in test files, with the same `// allow-test-rule:` exemption mechanism.

### Node.js Version Compatibility

**Node 22 is the minimum supported version.** Node 24 is the primary CI target. Node 26 is the forward-compatibility target: do not add tests or production code that depend on deprecated behavior likely to fail there.

| Version | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Node 22** | Minimum required — Active LTS until October 2026, Maintenance LTS until April 2027 |
| **Node 24** | Primary CI target — current Active LTS, all tests must pass |
| Node 26 | Forward-compatible target — avoid deprecated APIs and exact runtime-error prose |

Do not use:
- Deprecated APIs
- APIs not available in Node 22

Safe to use:
- `node:test` — stable since Node 18, fully featured in 24
- `describe`/`it`/`test` — all supported
- `beforeEach`/`afterEach`/`before`/`after` — all supported
- `t.after()` — per-test cleanup
- `mock.method()` — approved for scoped filesystem/subprocess fault injection
- `t.plan()` — fully supported
- Snapshot testing — fully supported

### Assertions

Use `node:assert/strict` for strict equality by default:

```javascript
const assert = require('node:assert/strict');

assert.strictEqual(actual, expected);      // ===
assert.deepStrictEqual(actual, expected);  // deep ===
assert.ok(value);                          // truthy
assert.throws(() => { ... }, /pattern/);   // throws
assert.rejects(async () => { ... });       // async throws
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a single test file
node --test tests/core.test.cjs

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

For examples of required negative matrices, parser fixtures, filesystem fault injection, security abuse tests, generated-file checks, and runtime/SDK parity tests, see [`TEST-EXAMPLES.md`](./TEST-EXAMPLES.md).

### Preferred local benchmark runner (before PR)

When you can, run the local test bench harness before opening a PR — especially for Windows-sensitive changes.

- Setup guide: [gsd-test-runner getting started](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-test-runner/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md)
- Preferred PR evidence: include the bench results summary (or artifact link) in your PR body.

This gives maintainers a faster, higher-confidence signal than CI-only validation.

### Pre-PR Seam Checks (Manifest/Alias Routing)

If you touched any of the command-manifest or generated alias files, run:

```bash
npm run check:alias-drift
```

This verifies generated alias artifacts are in sync with manifest source-of-truth.

Optional local pre-commit hook entry (Git-native):

```bash
# one-time setup
mkdir -p .githooks
cat > .githooks/pre-commit <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -Eq "^sdk/src/query/command-manifest\.|^sdk/src/query/command-aliases\.generated\.ts$|^gsd-core/bin/lib/command-aliases\.generated\.cjs$|^sdk/scripts/gen-command-aliases\.ts$"; then
  npm run check:alias-drift
fi
EOF
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Optional local pre-push hook to block a private author-email pattern:

```bash
# set locally in your shell profile (example)
export GSD_BLOCKED_AUTHOR_REGEX='@example-corp\\.com$'

cat > .githooks/pre-push <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

zero_sha='0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
blocked_regex="${GSD_BLOCKED_AUTHOR_REGEX:-}"
[[ -z "$blocked_regex" ]] && exit 0
violations=()

while read -r local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha; do
  [[ "$local_sha" == "$zero_sha" ]] && continue
  if [[ "$remote_sha" == "$zero_sha" ]]; then
    commits=$(git rev-list "$local_sha" --not --remotes)
  else
    commits=$(git rev-list "$remote_sha..$local_sha")
  fi
  while read -r commit; do
    [[ -z "$commit" ]] && continue
    email=$(git show -s --format='%ae' "$commit" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
    if printf '%s' "$email" | grep -Eq "$blocked_regex"; then
      violations+=("$commit <$email>")
    fi
  done <<< "$commits"
done

if [[ ${#violations[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
  echo "Push blocked: commit author email matched local blocked regex ($blocked_regex)." >&2
  printf '  - %s\n' "${violations[@]}" >&2
  exit 1
fi
EOF
chmod +x .githooks/pre-push
```

### CI Test Quality Checks

The following checks run on every PR in addition to the test suite:

| Job | What it checks | How to pass |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| `Lint — ESLint` | No source-grep tests (see above), via the `local/no-source-grep` rule | Replace with `runGsdTools()` behavioral tests, or add `// allow-test-rule: <reason>` |

Run locally before pushing: `npm run lint` (or `npx eslint .`)

### Architecture-Aware Testing Requirements

When work touches architecture, routing, policy, registry assembly, or command semantics:
- Write tests against module **interfaces** and seam behavior, not implementation trivia.
- Prefer invariant/contract tests that protect ADR-backed behavior and `CONTEXT.md` terminology.
- Ensure tests validate canonical behavior through the defined seam (for example: structured result contracts, canonical command metadata, and adapter parity), not source-text coupling.
- If ADRs define expected behavior, tests should assert those expectations directly.

### Test Requirements by Contribution Type

The required tests differ depending on what you are contributing:

**Bug Fix:** A regression test is required. Write the test first — it must demonstrate the original failure before your fix is applied, then pass after the fix. A PR that fixes a bug without a regression test will be asked to add one. If the bug involves CLI input, parsers, filesystem writes, security/prompt surfaces, generated files, or SDK/runtime parity, the regression test must use the relevant QA matrix above and include negative proof that the bad behavior no longer happens. "Tests pass" does not prove correctness; it proves the bug isn't present in the tests that exist.

**Enhancement:** Tests covering the enhanced behavior are required. Update any existing tests that test the area you changed. If the enhancement expands accepted input, changes command routing, broadens parser behavior, changes generated output, or touches installer/write paths, add the relevant adversarial cases from the QA matrix above. Do not leave tests that pass but no longer accurately describe the behavior.

**Feature:** Tests are required for the primary success path and enough failure scenarios to cover the relevant QA matrix above. At minimum, every feature must cover one failure scenario; features that expose CLI input, parse user files, write files, generate artifacts, call subprocesses, or build prompts must cover the relevant negative/hostile cases. Leaving gaps in test coverage for a new feature is a rejection reason.

**Behavior Change:** If your change modifies existing behavior, the existing tests covering that behavior must be updated or replaced. For high-risk surfaces, update the adversarial tests as well as the happy path. Leaving passing-but-incorrect tests in the suite is not acceptable — a test that passes but asserts the old (now wrong) behavior makes the suite less useful than no test at all.

### Reviewer Standards

Reviewers do not rely solely on CI to verify correctness. Before approving a PR, reviewers:

- Build locally (`npm run build` if applicable)
- Run the full test suite locally (`npm test`)
- Confirm regression tests exist for bug fixes and that they would fail without the fix
- Validate that the implementation matches what the linked issue described — green CI on the wrong implementation is not an approval signal

**"Tests pass in CI" is not sufficient for merge.** The implementation must correctly solve the problem described in the linked issue.

## Code Review Lessons

### Input validation: check shape, not just type

Defensive normalization at trust boundaries must validate both the value's type and its semantic shape. A `typeof === 'string'` check is necessary but insufficient when the field's contract requires a specific format (UUID v4, semver, file path, etc.). See [ADR 227](docs/adr/227-input-validation-shape-not-just-type.md) for the architectural standard and concrete cases.

## Code Style

- **CommonJS** (`.cjs`) — the project uses `require()`, not ESM `import`
- **No external dependencies in core** — `gsd-tools.cjs` and all lib files use only Node.js built-ins
- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`

                          to mode files. See workflows/discuss-phase/ as
                          the canonical example (#2551). New modes for
                          discuss-phase land in

                          Per-file sizes are pinned by a committed baseline
                          (tests/workflow-size-baseline.json) plus loose tier
                          hard caps, both in tests/workflow-size-budget.test.cjs.
                          If you legitimately grow or shrink a workflow file,
                          run `npm run size:baseline` to update the snapshot and

### Source of truth for agents

Only `agents/` at the repo root is tracked by git. The following directories may exist on a developer machine with GSD installed and **must not be edited** — they are install-sync outputs and will be overwritten:

| Path | Gitignored | What it is |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `.claude/agents/` | Yes (`.gitignore:9`) | Local Claude Code runtime sync |
| `.cursor/agents/` | Yes (`.gitignore:12`) | Local Cursor IDE bundle |
| `.github/agents/gsd-*` | Yes (`.gitignore:37`) | Local CI-surface bundle |

If you find that `.claude/agents/` has drifted from `agents/` (e.g., after a branch change), re-run `bin/install.js` to re-sync from the canonical source. Always edit `agents/` — never the derivative directories.

## Security

- **Path validation** — use `validatePath()` from `security.cjs` for any user-provided paths
- **No shell injection** — use `execFileSync` (array args) over `execSync` (string interpolation)
- **No `${{ }}` in GitHub Actions `run:` blocks** — bind to `env:` mappings first
