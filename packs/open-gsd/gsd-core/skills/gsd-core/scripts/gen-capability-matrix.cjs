/**
 * gen-capability-matrix.cjs — ADR-1244 Phase 6 (Decision D9).
 *
 * Generates docs/reference/capability-matrix.md FROM the committed capability
 * registry (gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs), so the matrix can never
 * drift from the actual capability set. Kept honest by a drift guard
 * (tests/capability-matrix-sync.test.cjs runs `--check`).
 *
 * The matrix is RELEASE-STABLE by design: it does NOT embed each capability's
 * exact `version` (which tracks the GSD package version in lockstep and would
 * churn the committed file — and trip the drift guard — on every release). It
 * shows `engines.gsd` (the stable host-compatibility RANGE) instead, and notes
 * the version-lockstep rule in prose. The committed matrix therefore changes
 * only on intentional capability edits (add/remove a capability, change its
 * tier/role/engines/extension-points/hook-kinds) — never on a version bump.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/gen-capability-matrix.cjs            # print to stdout
 *   node scripts/gen-capability-matrix.cjs --write    # write the committed file
 *   node scripts/gen-capability-matrix.cjs --check    # exit 1 if the committed file is stale

## Column definitions

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **id** | Canonical capability identifier; unique across first- and third-party capabilities. Reserved prefixes: \`gsd-\`, \`gsd-core-\`, \`anthropic-\`. |
| **role** | \`feature\` — extends what the loop does; \`runtime\` — adapts GSD to a specific AI runtime/IDE. |
| **tier** | \`core\` — always active; \`standard\` — active when the runtime supports it; \`full\` — opt-in or runtime-specific. |
| **engines.gsd** | Semver RANGE expressing host-version compatibility. A hard gate at install and at load. \`—\` means the capability declares no range. |
| **extension points** | The loop points this capability registers hooks into (from the registry's \`byLoopPoint\` index). \`—\` means it registers none (typical for runtime capabilities, whose job is surface emission). |
| **hook kinds** | Which of \`step\`, \`contribution\`, \`gate\` the capability's hooks use. \`—\` means none. |
| **source** | \`first-party\` — ships with GSD Core; \`third-party\` — installed from an external source via \`gsd capability install\`. |

> **On versions.** This matrix intentionally omits a per-capability \`version\`
> column. First-party capabilities are versioned **in lockstep** with the GSD
> Core package (their \`capability.json\` \`version\` always equals the GSD release
> version), so a per-row version would simply repeat the package version and
> churn the committed file on every release. The stable host-compatibility
> signal — \`engines.gsd\` — is shown instead. A third-party capability's exact
> version is recorded in the per-runtime ledger (\`.gsd-capabilities.json\`) at
> install time.

## Native (first-party) capabilities

First-party capabilities are implicitly trusted: they ship as part of the GSD
Core package and are stamped with the package version at release (per
ADR-1244 D6). They are not subject to the consent or integrity-pin flow applied
to third-party capabilities.

### Feature capabilities (role: feature) — ${featureCount}

Feature capabilities extend what the loop does — contributing research,
planning, execution, verification, or ship artefacts at the loop extension
points.

${featureTable}

### Runtime capabilities (role: runtime) — ${runtimeCount}

Runtime capabilities adapt GSD to a specific AI runtime or IDE — emitting
skills, agents, hooks configuration, and surface files for that host. They
typically register no loop hooks (their primary responsibility is surface
emission), so their extension-point and hook-kind cells are \`—\`.

${runtimeTable}

## Third-party capabilities

This matrix is the **first-party catalogue**: it is generated from the committed
registry and therefore lists only the capabilities that ship with GSD Core.
Installed third-party capabilities are NOT written into this committed file. Once a
user installs one via \`gsd capability install <spec>\` it enters the **runtime
registry overlay** (ADR-1244 D2); the overlay-aware view of what is installed on a
given machine is \`gsd capability list\` (see the
[\`gsd capability\` command reference](gsd-capability-command.md)), which reports
first-party and installed third-party capabilities together using the same column
fields described below, with \`source\` = \`third-party\`.

### Column values for third-party rows

| Column | Value |
|---|---|
| **id** | As declared in \`capability.json\`. Must not use reserved prefixes (\`gsd-\`, \`gsd-core-\`, \`anthropic-\`). |
| **role** | \`feature\` or \`runtime\`, as declared. |
| **tier** | \`core\`, \`standard\`, or \`full\`, as declared. |
| **engines.gsd** | Range from \`capability.json\`; verified at install and at each load. |
| **extension points** | The loop points the capability registers into, validated against the known 12 identifiers. |
| **hook kinds** | \`step\`, \`contribution\`, and/or \`gate\` as declared. Disclosed in the consent summary at install. |
| **source** | \`third-party\` |

### Community registry

Whether GSD operates or advertises a central community registry of third-party
capabilities is **TBD/TBA** (PRD). The matrix mechanic and all manifest fields
ship regardless of that decision; URL/git/npm/tarball import does not depend on
a central registry.

## Manifest field reference

The fields below are defined in \`capability.json\` and govern how a capability
appears in this matrix. For the full schema, see
[ADR-1244 D1](../adr/1244-capability-ecosystem.md#d1--versioned-capability-manifest)
and the [capability manifest reference](capability-manifest.md).

| Field | Required | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| \`version\` | **Yes** | semver string | Capability version. The registry rejects manifests without it. |
| \`engines.gsd\` | Recommended | semver range | Host-version compatibility gate. Enforced at install and load. |
| \`compatVersions\` | No | object: cap-version → gsd-range | Graceful-downgrade table for sources that enumerate versions (git tags, registry, npm). |
| \`integrity\` | No | \`sha512-<base64>\` | SHA-512 digest of the fetched bundle. Verified before extraction when present; mismatch aborts. |
| \`provenance\` | No | \`{ sourceRepo, commit }\` | Source provenance; populated in CI for first-party/curated capabilities. |
