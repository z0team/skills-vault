/**
 * Used by the release-sdk hotfix cherry-pick loop to decide whether a
 * candidate commit can possibly change what ships in the npm package.
 *
 * Reads a newline-separated list of paths from stdin (typically the
 * output of `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r <SHA>`) and
 * exits with one of three codes so the workflow can distinguish a
 * legitimate "skip this commit" signal from a classifier failure.
 *
 * "Shipped" = the union of:
 *   - package.json (always included by `npm pack`, regardless of `files`)
 *   - every entry in package.json `files`, treated as either an exact
 *     file match or a directory prefix (matching `npm pack` semantics).
 *   - CI-gating test paths: `tests/<anything>` — these don't ship in the
 *     tarball, but they gate the hotfix-branch test job. A test fixture
 *     update that aligns with a cherry-picked production fix MUST be
 *     pickable or CI fails on the hotfix run.
 *     #3621 — root cause of the v1.42.3 hotfix red CI.
 *
 * `package-lock.json` is intentionally NOT considered shipped — `npm pack`
 * excludes it from the tarball unless it's explicitly in `files`, and at
 * the time of writing this repo's `files` whitelist does not include it.
 *
 * Exit codes (the workflow MUST treat these distinctly — bug #2983):
 *   0  at least one path is shipped       → cherry-pick is meaningful
 *   1  no shipped paths                   → CI / test / docs / planning
 *                                            only; hotfix loop skips
 *   2  classifier error                   → bad/missing package.json,
 *                                            I/O failure, or any
 *                                            uncaught exception. The
 *                                            workflow MUST fail-fast on
 *                                            this code rather than
 *                                            treating it as a skip.
 *
 * Why distinct codes: Node's default exit code for uncaught throws is 1,
 * which would otherwise be indistinguishable from the legitimate "no
 * shipped paths" result. CodeRabbit on PR #2981 / bug #2983.
