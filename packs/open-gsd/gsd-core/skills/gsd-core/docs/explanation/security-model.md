## Why AI-driven development needs a dedicated security posture

A conventional code editor does not execute arbitrary packages on your behalf.
GSD Core does. The research → plan → execute pipeline automates the full path
from "name a package" to "run `npm install <package>`", from "write a
planning artifact" to "use that artifact as an LLM system prompt". Each
automation step removes a human from the loop — and each removal is a
potential attack surface.

GSD Core's security model is built around one organising principle:
**defence in depth**. No single control is assumed to be perfect. Several
overlapping layers each reduce a distinct class of risk, and together they
make the attack surface substantially harder to exploit without eliminating
it entirely. The honest summary at the end of this document explains what the
system cannot protect against.

## Layer 1 — Supply-chain protection: the Package Legitimacy Gate

### The threat

AI models hallucinate package names. This is not a fringe failure mode: 2025
research documents roughly 20 % of AI-generated package references as
hallucinated names that do not correspond to legitimate packages. A subset of
those hallucinated names — approximately 43 % in the same research — recur
consistently across prompts, meaning an attacker can observe which names AI
tools commonly produce and pre-register those names on npm, PyPI, or
crates.io with malicious post-install scripts. The technique is called
*slopsquatting*.

The insidious quality of slopsquatting is that a hallucinated name that passes
`npm view` *looks legitimate*. The registry entry proves only that someone
registered the name — not that the package does what the AI said it does, not
that it has any legitimate users, and not that its install scripts are safe.
Without a gate, a hallucinated name would flow undetected through GSD's
researcher → planner → executor pipeline and eventually run as
`npm install <attacker-package>` on your machine.

### How the gate works

The gate operates across three pipeline stages:

**Research stage.** When `gsd-phase-researcher` recommends external packages,
it runs `slopcheck install <pkgs> --json` against each one. The results are
written to a `## Package Legitimacy Audit` table in `RESEARCH.md`. Packages
tagged `[SLOP]` (high-confidence hallucination or attacker-registered) are
**stripped from `RESEARCH.md` entirely** before the file is saved. They never
reach the planner.

**Planning stage.** `gsd-planner` reads the Audit table. For any package
tagged `[SUS]` (suspicious: newly registered, low download count, no source
repository, or naming pattern close to a popular package) or `[ASSUMED]`
(sourced from WebSearch rather than direct registry verification), the planner
**inserts a `checkpoint:human-verify` task** before the install step. The
checkpoint includes a direct link to the registry page and specific things to
look for: maintainer history, issue-tracker activity, absence of suspicious
install scripts.

**Execution stage.** If an install fails, `gsd-executor` **surfaces a
checkpoint and stops**. It does not silently try an alternative package name —
which could itself be malicious. This is an explicit rule in the executor's
behaviour (RULE 3 in the executor agent definition).

### Why WebSearch packages are always `[ASSUMED]`

Package names discovered through WebSearch are tagged `[ASSUMED]` regardless
of whether `npm view` succeeds. A package that exists on the registry is not
the same as a package that is safe to install. `npm view` proves registration,
not legitimacy. The `[ASSUMED]` tag triggers the same human-verify checkpoint
as `[SUS]`, ensuring that any unverified web-discovered recommendation always
gets a human review before installation.

### Ecosystem coverage

The researcher uses registry-specific verification commands rather than a
single generic check:

- Node.js: `npm view`
- Python: `pip index versions`
- Rust: `cargo search`

This covers cross-ecosystem hallucination, which occurs at roughly 9 %
according to 2025 USENIX research — cases where an AI recommends a package
that exists in one ecosystem but not the one actually in use.

### Graceful degradation

If `slopcheck` is unavailable (not installed, or the pip install fails at
research time), GSD applies the strictest possible fallback: **every
recommended package is tagged `[ASSUMED]`**, and the planner gates every
install with a `checkpoint:human-verify` task. Research and planning proceed
normally — the system never hard-fails on a missing tool dependency. This
is intentionally stricter than the normal flow: slopcheck unavailability means
every package install gets a human checkpoint.

The `slopcheck` tool is MIT-licensed and pip-installable. If it is ever
abandoned, the `[ASSUMED]`-gate fallback ensures human-checkpoint coverage is
maintained regardless.

## Layer 2 — Prompt injection defences

### The threat

GSD Core generates Markdown files that become LLM system prompts. The
research pipeline reads external web content; the planning pipeline
incorporates user-supplied text (`--text-file`, `--prd`); the execution
pipeline writes planning artifacts that are later re-read as agent context.
Any user-controlled text flowing into these artifacts is a potential
**indirect prompt injection** vector — an attacker-controlled string that,
once inside a system prompt, attempts to override the agent's instructions or
exfiltrate information.

### How the defences work

GSD Core addresses prompt injection at three levels.

**Input validation (`security.cjs`).** The `gsd-core/bin/lib/security.cjs`
module is the central security utility. It provides:

- Path traversal prevention: user-supplied file paths (`--text-file`, `--prd`)
  are validated to resolve within the project directory, with macOS
  `/var` → `/private/var` symlink resolution handled explicitly
- Prompt injection detection: known injection patterns (role overrides,
  instruction bypasses, system tag injections) are scanned in user-supplied
  text before it enters any planning artifact
- Safe JSON parsing: a wrapper that prevents prototype-pollution attacks via
  crafted JSON payloads
- Shell argument validation: arguments passed to subshell commands are
  validated before use

**Runtime hook: `gsd-prompt-guard.js`.** This hook fires on every Write or
Edit call that targets `.planning/` files. It scans the content being written
for the same injection patterns as `security.cjs` (a subset inlined directly
into the hook for independence — the hook does not `require()` the module, so
it runs even if the module path changes). Detection is **advisory-only**: the
hook logs the finding but does not block the write. The rationale is that a
false-positive block on a legitimate planning write would be more disruptive
than a missed injection in a secondary scan layer.

**Runtime hook: `gsd-read-injection-scanner.js`.** This hook fires on the
output of every Read tool call. It scans the *content that was just read* for
injected instructions in untrusted content — catching cases where an attacker
has embedded instructions in a file that GSD is about to incorporate into an
agent's context.

**CI scanner.** `prompt-injection-scan.security.test.cjs` scans all agent, workflow,
and command files for embedded injection vectors as part of the test suite.
This catches injection attempts in the GSD source itself — for example, a
supply-chain attack that modified a workflow file to add a role-override
instruction.

### Read Injection Scanner vs Prompt Guard

The two hooks cover complementary surfaces. `gsd-prompt-guard.js` watches
*writes to planning artifacts* — it catches injection being planted. 
`gsd-read-injection-scanner.js` watches *reads of any file* — it catches
injection being ingested from external content (a dependency's README, a
third-party config file, a user-provided document). Together they bracket
the ingest → store → re-read lifecycle.

## Layer 3 — Repository and dependency integrity

Upstream of GSD's runtime behaviour, the `open-gsd` organisation enforces
controls at the repository and package level. These are documented in full in
[`docs/security/baseline.md`](../security/baseline.md) and are summarised
here for completeness.

**Dependency integrity.** All third-party dependencies are pinned via
`package-lock.json` and verified against published checksums before install.
A `scripts/check-npm-integrity.cjs` gate detects invalid versions, missing
packages, and extraneous packages at CI time. This mitigates dependency
confusion and typosquatting attacks against GSD's own dependencies.

**Secret scanning.** Every commit and PR is scanned for hardcoded secrets.
Intentional test fixtures must be annotated with the project-standard
exclusion grammar (see `SECURITY.md` for the annotation format). Un-annotated
suppressions fail CI.

**Locale-safe text scanning.** Output and user-facing strings are scanned for
Unicode homoglyphs, bidirectional override characters, and invisible Unicode —
the class of attacks documented in CVE-2021-42574 ("Trojan Source") that can
hide malicious content in diffs.

## Trade-offs and limits

The security model described here meaningfully reduces the attack surface for
AI-driven development. It does not eliminate supply-chain risk.

**What the Package Legitimacy Gate reduces:** The probability that a
hallucinated or attacker-registered package reaches `npm install` without
a human checkpoint. The `[SLOP]` gate removes high-confidence bad packages
entirely; the `[SUS]` / `[ASSUMED]` gates require human review before
execution. This substantially raises the cost of a successful slopsquatting
attack.

**What the Package Legitimacy Gate does not eliminate:** A legitimate package
that is later compromised (account takeover, dependency confusion in its own
tree) is not caught by slopcheck, which checks registration signals at
research time. Lock files and `npm audit` at the dependency-integrity layer
are the controls for that class of attack.

**What the prompt injection defences reduce:** The probability that
user-controlled text in planning artifacts successfully overrides agent
instructions. Pattern-matching on known injection forms catches the
common cases; novel jailbreaks or low-signal injections may pass undetected.
The advisory-only posture means detection is logged but not blocked — a
deliberate choice that preserves workflow continuity at the cost of
not hard-stopping on a detection.

**What the prompt injection defences do not eliminate:** A sufficiently
creative injection that does not match known patterns, or an injection that
arrives through a channel the hooks do not cover (for example, content injected
into a dependency's published README that is read by a subagent browsing
documentation). Defence in depth means each layer makes the attack harder,
not that any single layer makes it impossible.

**Reporting vulnerabilities.** Report via private GitHub security advisory at
`https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/security/advisories/new`. Do not open
public issues. See [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) for the response timeline
and disclosure policy.
