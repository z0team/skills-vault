# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for GSD.

Each ADR documents one architectural decision: what was decided, why, and what consequences follow. ADRs are append-only. Amendments extend existing ADRs with a dated section rather than replacing them.

## Naming Convention

New ADRs use **issue#-prefix slug** naming:

```text
docs/adr/<issue#>-<kebab-slug>.md
```

Examples: `3485-adr-prd-naming-convention.md`, `3464-review-default-reviewers.md`.

### Why

Two developers computing "next ADR number" locally against `main` will independently pick the same integer and both ship. The collision is already on disk — `0010-*` exists twice and `0011-*` exists three times. GitHub issue numbers are server-assigned and atomic: the moment you open an issue, that number is reserved globally. Two PRs that both edit the `### Fixed` block of `CHANGELOG.md` always conflict on merge — two PRs that each use a distinct issue# as their ADR prefix never collide. Same shape, same solution.

### Legacy ADRs

Files `0001-*` through `0011-*` are preserved as immutable historical record. The duplicate `0010-*` and the three-way `0011-*` are documented residue of the old local-compute convention — not patterns to imitate. Do not renumber them.

### Full process

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md — "Proposing an ADR or PRD"](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#proposing-an-adr-or-prd)** for the end-to-end workflow: opening the issue, waiting for approval, naming the file, and submitting the PR.

## Seam map

ADR 0005 is the top-level SDK seam index. It references per-seam ADRs and states the narrow-waist principle each seam follows. Use it as the entry point for understanding SDK module ownership.

ADR 0006 documents how SDK query handlers project planning paths (`cwd → effectiveRoot → .planning/<project>/...`). Cross-reference with the Planning Workspace Module (ADR 0004) for workstream pointer policy.

ADR 0008 documents the Installer Migration Module for safe install-time moves, removals, config rewrites, and user-data preservation.

ADR 0009 documents the Shell Command Projection Module seam for runtime-aware
projection of installer-owned command text and projection IR.

ADR 0010 documents the File Operation Engine Module seam for converging
installer/migration/planning file mutation safety policy, and its relationship
to ADR 0009 hook-command ownership policy.

ADR 0011 documents the Skill Surface Budget Module for install-time skill/agent
profile staging (`--profile=<name>`, `.gsd-profile` marker, `requires:` closure)
and the Phase 2 runtime `/gsd:surface` command for cluster-level enable/disable
without reinstall.

ADR 1411 establishes the Resolution Provenance principle: context resolution
(config loading, project-root anchoring, workstream resolution) must report its
provenance rather than fall open silently to defaults. It is the resolution-side
analog of ADR 227 (input-validation shape), binds the Config Loader Module,
Project-Root Resolution Module, and I/O Module, and is the decision record for
epic #1411 (phases P1–P4).
