# Claude Code Plugin Manifest Module owns the projection of gsd-core surfaces onto the Claude Code plugin contract

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-07
- **Issue:** #766
- **Implementation:** PR #797

## Context

gsd-core has, until now, reached Claude Code through exactly one Adapter: the file-copy installer. The **Runtime Artifact Layout Module** (ADR-3660) projects gsd-core's artifact surfaces (`commands`, `agents`, `skills`) onto per-runtime filesystem placements, and the **Runtime Install Policy Module** (ADR-58) composes those placements with command text and config intentions into a typed install plan that adapters write to `~/.claude/` / `.claude/`.

Claude Code now exposes a second, first-class way to receive the same surfaces: the **plugin contract** — a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest plus a `hooks/hooks.json`, consumed either by a marketplace install or by the zero-friction `@skills-dir` path. This contract is an *external interface owned by Claude Code*, not by gsd-core: it has its own schema, its own namespacing rules (`/<plugin-name>:<command>`), its own validation tool (`claude plugin validate`), and its own constraints (notably: plugin-shipped agents may not carry `hooks` / `permissionMode` / `mcpServers` frontmatter — Claude Code silently ignores them).

Before this ADR, the only record of how gsd-core maps onto that external contract was the manifest files themselves. A hand-authored config file with no named Seam invites drift: the manifest's hook wiring silently diverges from what the Installer Module wires into `settings.json`; the identity fields drift from the Package Identity Module; and a future maintainer has no single place that says *which gsd-core surface maps to which manifest field, and why*. The plugin contract is exactly the kind of external interface that earns a defined, typed mapping rather than an ad-hoc file — the same reasoning that gave the file-copy path the Runtime Artifact Layout Module.

This is the structural signal the architecture review looks for: **two Adapters at one Seam.** The file-copy layout and the plugin manifest are two projections of *the same* gsd-core artifact surfaces onto two different distribution contracts. That makes the distribution Seam real, and the plugin-side projection deserves a name.

## Decision

Introduce the **Claude Code Plugin Manifest Module** as the Seam that owns the projection of gsd-core's artifact surfaces onto the Claude Code plugin contract. It is the plugin-contract sibling of the Runtime Artifact Layout Module: where that Module projects surfaces onto filesystem placements, this Module projects the same surfaces onto `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `hooks/hooks.json`.

The mapping is **defined, not incidental**:

| gsd-core surface / source | Claude Code plugin field | Rule / invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Package Identity Module `binName` | `name` | `gsd-core` — drives the `/gsd-core:` command namespace; must be kebab-case (no colon/space/uppercase). |
| Package Identity Module `repoUrl` | `repository`, `homepage` | derived, never re-typed. |
| `package.json` `version` / `description` / `license` | `version` / `description` / `license` | `version` is **required** for `claude plugin validate --strict` (a missing version is a strict failure), so it is synced to `package.json` and held by a drift-guard test. |
| Command surface (`commands/gsd/*.md`) | `commands: "./commands/gsd/"` | exposed as `/gsd-core:<command>`; namespacing replaces the file-copy path's `/gsd:<command>` (an additive UX change, not a data-format break). |
| Agent surface (`agents/*.md`) | *(omitted — default `agents/` discovery)* | the explicit `agents: <string>` form is rejected by the plugin schema; relying on Claude Code's default `agents/` discovery loads them and stays self-maintaining. Agents are already plugin-safe — their `hooks`/`permissionMode` frontmatter is inert. |
| Always-on hook policy (subset of the Installer Module's `settings.json` wiring) | `hooks: "./hooks/hooks.json"` | see below. |

The hook projection is the load-bearing part of this Module, because of the external constraint: a plugin's agents cannot carry hook frontmatter, so **all plugin-path hook wiring must live in `hooks/hooks.json`**. The Module projects *only the always-on subset* of the Installer Module's Claude hook wiring — `gsd-check-update` (SessionStart), `gsd-context-monitor` (PostToolUse), and the security guards `gsd-prompt-guard` / `gsd-read-guard` / `gsd-worktree-path-guard` / `gsd-read-injection-scanner` — preserving each event, matcher, and timeout. The installer's **config-gated opt-in** hooks (workflow-guard, validate-commit, graphify-update, session-state, phase-boundary, update-banner) are deliberately excluded: a static manifest cannot read a project's `.planning/config.json` to honor those gates, so projecting them would run them unconditionally — a behavior change the Module must not introduce. Hook commands reference bundled scripts through Claude Code's `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable.

The interface of this Module is therefore a **conformance contract**, validated two ways: `claude plugin validate --strict` (the external tool's view) and an in-repo drift-guard test (`tests/issue-766-plugin-manifest.test.cjs`) that locks the identity mapping, the version sync, the always-on hook contract, and the absence of opt-in hooks. Manifest component paths are resolved relative to the **plugin root** (the directory containing `.claude-plugin/`), which is the repository root.

This is **additive**. The file-copy path — Runtime Artifact Layout Module, Runtime Install Policy Module, Installer Module — is unchanged. The plugin manifest is a parallel Adapter, the fallback for users on older Claude Code versions that predate the plugin contract.

## What stays OUTSIDE this Module

To keep the Seam honest about where the plugin contract ends:

- **Runtime execution.** The Module projects the command/agent/hook *surface* and lifecycle metadata. It does not make gsd commands self-contained: their backing logic still resolves the gsd runtime CLI (`gsd-tools`) and `node` on `PATH`. The plugin delivers discoverability and lifecycle (`claude plugin enable|disable|update`); it does not replace the runtime.
- **The file-copy install.** Filesystem placement, `settings.json` merge semantics, and per-runtime config rendering remain owned by the Runtime Artifact Layout / Install Policy / Installer Modules.
- **Marketplace listing.** Publishing gsd-core to a marketplace registry is an external, out-of-repo act.
- **Manifest emission by the installer.** Having `bin/install.js` drop the manifest in-place for the npm `@skills-dir` path is a follow-up; the repo-root manifest already serves the marketplace and git-clone `@skills-dir` paths.

## Consequences

- gsd-core gains a one-command install/update/disable lifecycle and automatic `/gsd-core:` namespacing that prevents slash-command collisions, without disturbing the file-copy path.
- The plugin contract gains a named place in the glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) and a defined mapping, so future surface additions have an obvious projection target instead of an ad-hoc file edit.
- **Latent duplication is now named, not hidden.** The always-on hook policy is currently encoded twice — imperatively in the Installer Module's `settings.json` wiring, and declaratively in `hooks/hooks.json` — kept in agreement only by the drift-guard test. This ADR records that as the known cost of a *static* manifest. Elevating the Module from a hand-authored manifest to a **generated projection** (stamping `plugin.json` from the Package Identity Module + `package.json`, and `hooks/hooks.json` from `managed-hooks-registry.cjs` + a shared always-on-hook policy) would collapse the duplication to one source — the same generated-single-source move ADR-457 made for `.cjs` and the Runtime Install Policy Module made for install plans. Deferred; see Open questions.
- The `name` field is a stability surface: it is the published `/gsd-core:` namespace. Changing it is a user-visible break under Hyrum's law, the same way command names are.
- Rollout is incremental: this ADR + the hand-authored manifest land first (#766/PR#797); installer-emit, release-time version stamping, and the generated projection are tracked follow-ups under #766.

## Open questions

- Should this Module be **generated** rather than hand-authored, deriving `version` (and identity) at build/release time so a `package.json` bump cannot leave `plugin.json` stale? The release pipeline bumps via `npm version --no-git-tag-version` with no regeneration hook, so today the drift-guard test enforces the sync manually (idiomatic with the repo's other drift guards, but a release speed-bump).
- Should the always-on-hook policy be lifted into a single shared source consumed by *both* the Installer Module and this Module, retiring the dual hand-encoding?
