## Core Features

### 1. Project Initialization

**Command:** `/gsd-new-project [--auto @file.md]`

**Purpose:** Transform a user's idea into a fully structured project with research, scoped requirements, and a phased roadmap.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-INIT-01: System MUST conduct adaptive questioning until project scope is fully understood
- REQ-INIT-02: System MUST spawn parallel research agents to investigate the domain ecosystem
- REQ-INIT-03: System MUST extract requirements into v1 (must-have), v2 (future), and out-of-scope categories
- REQ-INIT-04: System MUST generate a phased roadmap with requirement traceability
- REQ-INIT-05: System MUST require user approval of the roadmap before proceeding
- REQ-INIT-06: System MUST prevent re-initialization when `.planning/PROJECT.md` already exists
- REQ-INIT-07: System MUST support `--auto @file.md` flag to skip interactive questions and extract from a document

**Produces:**
| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, constraints, technical decisions, evolution rules |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped requirements with unique IDs (REQ-XX) |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Phase breakdown with status tracking and requirement mapping |
| `STATE.md` | Initial project state with position, decisions, metrics |
| `config.json` | Workflow configuration |
| `research/SUMMARY.md` | Synthesized domain research |
| `research/STACK.md` | Technology stack investigation |
| `research/FEATURES.md` | Feature implementation patterns |
| `research/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architecture patterns and trade-offs |
| `research/PITFALLS.md` | Common failure modes and mitigations |

**Process:**
1. **Questions** — Adaptive questioning guided by the "dream extraction" philosophy (not requirements gathering)
2. **Research** — 4 parallel researcher agents investigate stack, features, architecture, and pitfalls
3. **Synthesis** — Research synthesizer combines findings into SUMMARY.md
4. **Requirements** — Extracted from user responses + research, categorized by scope
5. **Roadmap** — Phase breakdown mapped to requirements, with granularity setting controlling phase count

**Functional Requirements:**
- Questions adapt based on detected project type (web app, CLI, mobile, API, etc.)
- Research agents have web search capability for current ecosystem information
- Granularity setting controls phase count: `coarse` (2-4), `standard` (4-6), `fine` (6-10)
- `--auto` mode extracts all information from the provided document without interactive questioning
- Existing codebase context (from `/gsd-map-codebase`) is loaded if present

---

### 2. Phase Discussion

**Command:** `/gsd-discuss-phase [N] [--auto] [--batch]`

**Purpose:** Capture user's implementation preferences and decisions before research and planning begin. Eliminates the gray areas that cause AI to guess.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-DISC-01: System MUST analyze the phase scope and identify decision areas (gray areas)
- REQ-DISC-02: System MUST categorize gray areas by type (visual, API, content, organization, etc.)
- REQ-DISC-03: System MUST ask only questions not already answered in prior CONTEXT.md files
- REQ-DISC-04: System MUST persist decisions in `{phase}-CONTEXT.md` with canonical references
- REQ-DISC-05: System MUST support `--auto` flag to auto-select recommended defaults
- REQ-DISC-06: System MUST support `--batch` flag for grouped question intake
- REQ-DISC-07: System MUST scout relevant source files before identifying gray areas (code-aware discussion)
- REQ-DISC-08: System MUST adapt gray area language to product-outcome terms when USER-PROFILE.md indicates a non-technical owner (learning_style: guided, jargon in frustration_triggers, or high-level explanation depth)
- REQ-DISC-09: When REQ-DISC-08 applies, advisor_research rationale paragraphs MUST be rewritten in plain language — same decisions, translated framing

**Produces:** `{padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md` — User preferences that feed into research and planning

**Gray Area Categories:**
| Category | Example Decisions |
|----------|-------------------|
| Visual features | Layout, density, interactions, empty states |
| APIs/CLIs | Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity |
| Content systems | Structure, tone, depth, flow |
| Organization | Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates, exceptions |

---

### 3. UI Design Contract

**Command:** `/gsd-ui-phase [N]`

**Purpose:** Lock design decisions before planning so that all components in a phase share consistent visual standards.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-UI-01: System MUST detect existing design system state (shadcn components.json, Tailwind config, tokens)
- REQ-UI-02: System MUST ask only unanswered design contract questions
- REQ-UI-03: System MUST validate against 6 dimensions (Copywriting, Visuals, Color, Typography, Spacing, Registry Safety)
- REQ-UI-04: System MUST enter revision loop if validation returns BLOCKED (max 2 iterations)
- REQ-UI-05: System MUST offer shadcn initialization for React/Next.js/Vite projects without `components.json`
- REQ-UI-06: System MUST enforce registry safety gate for third-party shadcn registries

**Produces:** `{padded_phase}-UI-SPEC.md` — Design contract consumed by executors

**6 Validation Dimensions:**
1. **Copywriting** — CTA labels, empty states, error messages
2. **Visuals** — Focal points, visual hierarchy, icon accessibility
3. **Color** — Accent usage discipline, 60/30/10 compliance
4. **Typography** — Font size/weight constraint adherence
5. **Spacing** — Grid alignment, token consistency
6. **Registry Safety** — Third-party component inspection requirements

**shadcn Integration:**
- Detects missing `components.json` in React/Next.js/Vite projects
- Guides user through `ui.shadcn.com/create` preset configuration
- Preset string becomes a planning artifact reproducible across phases
- Safety gate requires `npx shadcn view` and `npx shadcn diff` before third-party components

---

### 4. Phase Planning

**Command:** `/gsd-plan-phase [N] [--auto] [--skip-research] [--skip-verify]`

**Purpose:** Research the implementation domain and produce verified, atomic execution plans.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-PLAN-01: System MUST spawn a phase researcher to investigate implementation approaches
- REQ-PLAN-02: System MUST produce plans with 2-3 tasks each, sized for a single context window
- REQ-PLAN-03: System MUST structure plans as XML with `<task>` elements containing `name`, `files`, `action`, `verify`, and `done` fields
- REQ-PLAN-04: System MUST include `read_first` and `acceptance_criteria` sections in every plan
- REQ-PLAN-05: System MUST run plan checker verification loop (up to 3 iterations) unless `--skip-verify` is set
- REQ-PLAN-06: System MUST support `--skip-research` flag to bypass research phase
- REQ-PLAN-07: System MUST prompt user to run `/gsd-ui-phase` if frontend phase detected and no UI-SPEC.md exists (UI safety gate)
- REQ-PLAN-08: System MUST include Nyquist validation mapping when `workflow.nyquist_validation` is enabled
- REQ-PLAN-09: System MUST verify all phase requirements are covered by at least one plan before planning completes (requirements coverage gate)

**Produces:**
| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{phase}-RESEARCH.md` | Ecosystem research findings |
| `{phase}-{N}-PLAN.md` | Atomic execution plans (2-3 tasks each) |
| `{phase}-VALIDATION.md` | Test coverage mapping (Nyquist layer) |

**Plan Structure (XML):**
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Create login endpoint</name>
  <files>src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts</files>
  <action>
    Use jose for JWT. Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  </action>
  <verify>curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie</verify>
  <done>Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401</done>
</task>
```

**Plan Checker Verification (8 Dimensions):**
1. Requirement coverage — Plans address all phase requirements
2. Task atomicity — Each task is independently committable
3. Dependency ordering — Tasks sequence correctly
4. File scope — No excessive file overlap between plans
5. Verification commands — Each task has testable done criteria
6. Context fit — Tasks fit within a single context window
7. Gap detection — No missing implementation steps
8. Nyquist compliance — Tasks have automated verify commands (when enabled)

---

### 5. Phase Execution

**Command:** `/gsd-execute-phase <N>`

**Purpose:** Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallelization with fresh context windows per executor.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-EXEC-01: System MUST analyze plan dependencies and group into execution waves
- REQ-EXEC-02: System MUST spawn independent plans in parallel within each wave
- REQ-EXEC-03: System MUST give each executor a fresh context window (200K tokens)
- REQ-EXEC-04: System MUST produce atomic git commits per task
- REQ-EXEC-05: System MUST produce a SUMMARY.md for each completed plan
- REQ-EXEC-06: System MUST run post-execution verifier to check phase goals were met
- REQ-EXEC-07: System MUST support git branching strategies (`none`, `phase`, `milestone`)
- REQ-EXEC-08: System MUST invoke node repair operator on task verification failure (when enabled)
- REQ-EXEC-09: System MUST run prior phases' test suites before verification to catch cross-phase regressions

**Produces:**
| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{phase}-{N}-SUMMARY.md` | Execution outcomes per plan |
| `{phase}-VERIFICATION.md` | Post-execution verification report |
| Git commits | Atomic commits per task |

**Wave Execution:**
- Plans with no dependencies → Wave 1 (parallel)
- Plans depending on Wave 1 → Wave 2 (parallel, waits for Wave 1)
- Continues until all plans complete
- File conflicts force sequential execution within same wave

**Executor Capabilities:**
- Reads PLAN.md with full task instructions
- Has access to PROJECT.md, STATE.md, CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md
- Commits each task atomically with structured commit messages
- Uses `--no-verify` on commits during parallel execution to avoid build lock contention
- Handles checkpoint types: `auto`, `checkpoint:human-verify`, `checkpoint:decision`, `checkpoint:human-action`
- Reports deviations from plan in SUMMARY.md

**Parallel Safety:**
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Skipped by parallel agents (`--no-verify`), run once by orchestrator after each wave
- **STATE.md locking**: File-level lockfile prevents concurrent write corruption across agents

---

### 6. Work Verification

- REQ-VERIFY-06: System MUST produce UAT.md with pass/fail results

**Produces:** `{phase}-UAT.md` — User acceptance test results, plus fix plans if issues found

---

### 6.5. Ship

**Command:** `/gsd-ship [N] [--draft]`

**Purpose:** Bridge local completion → merged PR. After verification passes, push branch, create PR with auto-generated body from planning artifacts, optionally trigger review, and track in STATE.md.

**Requirements:**

- REQ-SHIP-02: System MUST push branch and create PR via `gh` CLI
- REQ-SHIP-03: System MUST auto-generate PR body from SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md, and REQUIREMENTS.md
- REQ-SHIP-04: System MUST update STATE.md with shipping status and PR number
- REQ-SHIP-05: System MUST support `--draft` flag for draft PRs
- REQ-SHIP-06: System MUST support append-only project PR body sections configured with `ship.pr_body_sections`

**Prerequisites:** Phase verified, `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, work on feature branch

**Produces:** GitHub PR with rich body, optional configured PRD-style sections, STATE.md updated

**User documentation:** [Custom PR Body Sections](ship-pr-body-sections.md)

- REQ-NEXT-03: System MUST invoke the correct command automatically
- REQ-NEXT-04: System MUST suggest `/gsd-new-project` if no project exists
- REQ-NEXT-05: System MUST suggest `/gsd-complete-milestone` when all phases are complete

**State Detection Logic:**
| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No `.planning/` directory | Suggest `/gsd-new-project` |
| Phase has no CONTEXT.md | Run `/gsd-discuss-phase` |
| Phase has no PLAN.md files | Run `/gsd-plan-phase` |
| Phase has plans but no SUMMARY.md | Run `/gsd-execute-phase` |
| Phase executed but no VERIFICATION.md | Run `/gsd-verify-work` |
| All phases complete | Suggest `/gsd-complete-milestone` |

## Quality Assurance Features

### 15. Nyquist Validation

**Purpose:** Map automated test coverage to phase requirements before any code is written. Named after the Nyquist sampling theorem — ensures a feedback signal exists for every requirement.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-NYQ-01: System MUST detect existing test infrastructure during plan-phase research
- REQ-NYQ-02: System MUST map each requirement to a specific test command
- REQ-NYQ-03: System MUST identify Wave 0 tasks (test scaffolding needed before implementation)
- REQ-NYQ-04: Plan checker MUST enforce Nyquist compliance as 8th verification dimension
- REQ-NYQ-05: System MUST support retroactive validation via `/gsd-validate-phase`
- REQ-NYQ-06: System MUST be disableable via `workflow.nyquist_validation: false`

**Produces:** `{phase}-VALIDATION.md` — Test coverage contract

**Retroactive Validation (`/gsd-validate-phase [N]`):**
- Scans implementation and maps requirements to tests
- Identifies gaps where requirements lack automated verification
- Spawns auditor to generate tests (max 3 attempts)
- Never modifies implementation code — only test files and VALIDATION.md
- Flags implementation bugs as escalations for user to address

## Context Engineering Features

### 22. Context Window Monitoring

**Purpose:** Prevent context rot by alerting both user and agent when context is running low.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-CTX-01: Statusline MUST display context usage percentage to user
- REQ-CTX-02: Context monitor MUST inject agent-facing warnings at ≤35% remaining (WARNING)

---

### 26. Model Profiles

**Command:** `/gsd-config --profile <quality|balanced|budget|adaptive|inherit>`

**Purpose:** Control which AI model each agent uses, balancing quality vs cost.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-MODEL-01: System MUST support 4 profiles: `quality`, `balanced`, `budget`, `inherit`
- REQ-MODEL-02: Each profile MUST define model tier per agent (see profile table)
- REQ-MODEL-03: Per-agent overrides MUST take precedence over profile

## Brownfield Features

### 27. Codebase Mapping

**Command:** `/gsd-map-codebase [area]`

**Purpose:** Analyze an existing codebase before starting a new project, so GSD understands what exists.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-MAP-01: System MUST spawn parallel mapper agents for each analysis area
- REQ-MAP-02: System MUST produce structured documents in `.planning/codebase/`
- REQ-MAP-03: System MUST detect: tech stack, architecture patterns, coding conventions, concerns
- REQ-MAP-04: Subsequent `/gsd-new-project` MUST load codebase mapping and focus questions on what's being added
- REQ-MAP-05: Optional `[area]` argument MUST scope mapping to a specific area

**Produces:**
| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `STACK.md` | Languages, frameworks, databases, infrastructure |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Patterns, layers, data flow, boundaries |
| `CONVENTIONS.md` | Naming, file organization, code style, testing patterns |
| `CONCERNS.md` | Technical debt, security issues, performance bottlenecks |
| `STRUCTURE.md` | Directory layout and file organization |
| `TESTING.md` | Test infrastructure, coverage, patterns |
| `INTEGRATIONS.md` | External services, APIs, third-party dependencies |

**Incremental remap — `--paths` (#2003):** The mapper accepts an optional
`--paths <p1,p2,...>` scope hint. When provided, it restricts exploration
to the listed repo-relative prefixes instead of scanning the whole tree.
This is the pathway used by the post-execute codebase-drift gate to refresh
only the subtrees the phase actually changed. Each produced document carries
`last_mapped_commit` in its YAML frontmatter so drift can be measured
against the mapping point, not HEAD.

### 27a. Post-Execute Codebase Drift Detection

**Introduced by:** #2003
**Trigger:** Runs automatically at the end of every `/gsd-execute-phase`
**Configuration:**
- `workflow.drift_threshold` (integer, default `3`) — minimum new
  structural elements before the gate acts.
- `workflow.drift_action` (`warn` | `auto-remap`, default `warn`) —
  warn-only or spawn `gsd-codebase-mapper` with `--paths` scoped to
  affected subtrees.

**What counts as drift:**
- New directory outside mapped paths
- New barrel export at `(packages|apps)/*/src/index.*`
- New migration file (supabase/prisma/drizzle/src/migrations/…)
- New route module under `routes/` or `api/`

**Non-blocking guarantee:** any internal failure (missing STRUCTURE.md,
git errors, mapper spawn failure) logs a single line and the phase
continues. Drift detection cannot fail verification.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-DRIFT-01: System MUST detect the four drift categories from `git diff
  --name-status last_mapped_commit..HEAD`
- REQ-DRIFT-02: Action fires only when element count ≥ `workflow.drift_threshold`
- REQ-DRIFT-03: `warn` action MUST NOT spawn any agent
- REQ-DRIFT-04: `auto-remap` action MUST pass sanitized `--paths` to the mapper
- REQ-DRIFT-05: Detection/remap failure MUST be non-blocking for `/gsd-execute-phase`
- REQ-DRIFT-06: `last_mapped_commit` round-trip through YAML frontmatter
  on each `.planning/codebase/*.md` file

---

## Utility Features

---

### 32. Settings Management

**Command:** `/gsd-settings`

**Purpose:** Interactive configuration of workflow toggles and model profile.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-SETTINGS-01: System MUST present current settings with toggle options
- REQ-SETTINGS-02: System MUST update `.planning/config.json`
- REQ-SETTINGS-03: System MUST support saving as global defaults (`~/.gsd/defaults.json`)

**Configurable Settings:**
| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | enum | `interactive` | `interactive` or `yolo` (auto-approve) |
| `granularity` | enum | `standard` | `coarse`, `standard`, or `fine` |
| `model_profile` | enum | `balanced` | `quality`, `balanced`, `budget`, or `inherit` |
| `models.<phase_type>` | enum | (none) | Per-phase-type tier override (`planning`, `discuss`, `research`, `execution`, `verification`, `completion`). Values: `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `inherit`. Coarse phase-level tuning that wins over `model_profile` but loses to per-agent `model_overrides`. See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#per-phase-type-models-models--added-in-v140). Added in v1.40 |
| `granularities.<phase_type>` | enum | (none) | Per-phase-type granularity override (`planning`, `discuss`, `research`, `execution`, `verification`, `completion`). Values: `coarse`, `standard`, `fine`. Mirrors `models.<phase_type>` for granularity. See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#core-settings). Added in v1.43 ([#68](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/68)). `/gsd:plan-phase --granularity <coarse\|standard\|fine>` overrides all config-based granularity for a single invocation (takes precedence over `granularities.planning`, top-level `granularity`, and `planning.granularity`). ([#703](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/703)) |
| `dynamic_routing.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master switch for failure-tier escalation. When `true`, agents resolve to `tier_models[default_tier]` and escalate one tier on orchestrator-detected soft failure. Capped by `max_escalations`. See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#dynamic-routing-with-failure-tier-escalation-dynamic_routing--added-in-v140). Added in v1.40 |

| `workflow.plan_check` | boolean | `true` | Plan verification loop |
| `workflow.verifier` | boolean | `true` | Post-execution verification |
| `workflow.auto_advance` | boolean | `false` | Auto-chain discuss→plan→execute |
| `workflow.nyquist_validation` | boolean | `true` | Nyquist test coverage mapping |
| `workflow.ui_phase` | boolean | `true` | UI design contract generation |
| `workflow.ui_safety_gate` | boolean | `true` | Prompt for ui-phase on frontend phases |
| `workflow.node_repair` | boolean | `true` | Autonomous task repair |
| `workflow.node_repair_budget` | number | `2` | Max repair attempts per task |
| `planning.commit_docs` | boolean | `true` | Commit `.planning/` files to git |
| `planning.search_gitignored` | boolean | `false` | Include gitignored files in searches |
| `parallelization.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Run independent plans simultaneously |
| `git.branching_strategy` | enum | `none` | `none`, `phase`, or `milestone` |

---

### 33. Test Generation

**Command:** `/gsd-add-tests [N]`

**Purpose:** Generate tests for a completed phase based on UAT criteria and implementation.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-TEST-01: System MUST analyze completed phase implementation
- REQ-TEST-02: System MUST generate tests based on UAT criteria and acceptance criteria
- REQ-TEST-03: System MUST use existing test infrastructure patterns

---

## Infrastructure Features

### 34. Git Integration

**Requirements:**
- REQ-GIT-01: Each task MUST get its own atomic commit
- REQ-GIT-02: Commit messages MUST follow structured format: `type(scope): description`
- REQ-GIT-03: System MUST support 3 branching strategies: `none`, `phase`, `milestone`
- REQ-GIT-04: Phase strategy MUST create one branch per phase

**Commit Format:**
```
type(phase-plan): description

# Examples:
docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
fix(03-01): correct auth token expiry
```

---

### 35. CLI Tools

**Purpose:** Programmatic utilities for workflows and agents, replacing repetitive inline bash patterns.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-CLI-01: System MUST provide atomic commands for state, config, phase, roadmap operations
- REQ-CLI-02: System MUST provide compound `init` commands that load all context for each workflow
- REQ-CLI-03: System MUST support `--raw` flag for machine-readable output
- REQ-CLI-04: System MUST support `--cwd` flag for sandboxed subagent operation

---

### 36. Multi-Runtime Support

**Purpose:** Run GSD across multiple AI coding agent runtimes.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-RUNTIME-01: System MUST support Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Kilo, Codex, Copilot, Antigravity, Trae, Cline, Augment Code, CodeBuddy, Qwen Code
- REQ-RUNTIME-02: Installer MUST transform content per runtime (tool names, paths, frontmatter)
- REQ-RUNTIME-03: Installer MUST support interactive and non-interactive (`--claude --global`) modes
- REQ-RUNTIME-04: Installer MUST support both global and local installation
- REQ-RUNTIME-05: Uninstall MUST cleanly remove all GSD files without affecting other configurations
- REQ-RUNTIME-06: Installer MUST handle platform differences (Windows, macOS, Linux, WSL, Docker)
- REQ-RUNTIME-07: Runtimes with lifecycle hook support MUST register per-turn context-headroom tracking events at install time
- REQ-RUNTIME-08: Native packaging manifests MUST be version-stamped and enable runtime-native install/update/uninstall flows

**Runtime Transformations:**

| Aspect | Claude Code | OpenCode | Gemini | Kilo | Codex | Copilot | Antigravity | Cursor | Trae | Cline | Augment | CodeBuddy | Qwen Code |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|---------|-------------|--------|------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Commands | Slash commands | Slash commands | Slash commands (`{{args}}`) | Slash commands | Skills (TOML) | Slash commands | Skills | Skills + Slash commands | Skills | Rules | Skills + Slash commands | Slash commands | Skills |
| Agent format | Claude native | `mode: subagent` | Claude native | `mode: subagent` | Skills | Tool mapping | Skills | Skills | Skills | Rules | Skills | Skills | Skills |
| Skills emission | N/A | On-demand SKILL.md (1.4.0) | N/A | On-demand SKILL.md (1.4.0) | `/skills` picker (1.4.0) | N/A | N/A | SKILL.md | N/A | On-demand SKILL.md (1.4.0) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Hook events | `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`, `PreCompact`, `FileChanged` | N/A | `SessionStart`, `BeforeTool`, `AfterTool`, `BeforeAgent`, `AfterAgent`, `BeforeModel` | N/A | `SessionStart`, `SubagentStart`, `Stop`, `PostToolUse` | `sessionStart` | N/A | `sessionStart`, `postToolUse` | N/A | `PreToolUse` | N/A | N/A | `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`, `PreCompact` |
| Config | `settings.json` | `opencode.json(c)` | `settings.json` | `kilo.json(c)` | TOML | Instructions | Config | Config | Config | `.clinerules` | Config | Config | Config |

**Cursor artifact surfaces:** `gsd install --cursor` writes two artifact kinds:
- `~/.cursor/skills/gsd-<name>/SKILL.md` — rich skills with YAML frontmatter, Cursor tool-name mapping, and adapter context header (existing surface)
- `~/.cursor/commands/gsd-<name>.md` — plain markdown slash commands (no frontmatter) invocable via `/` in the Agent input (Cursor 1.6+)

**Native skills emission (1.4.0):** Three runtimes now emit GSD as on-demand native skills (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) at install time, in addition to their existing command and agent surfaces. Skills respect the active install profile and are removed on uninstall.
- **Cline** (global installs, Cline >= v3.48.0) — emits skills alongside the existing `.clinerules/` directory
- **Kilo** — emits skills alongside `command/` and `agents/`
- **OpenCode** — emits skills alongside its existing surfaces

**New slash-command surfaces (1.4.0):**
- **CodeBuddy** — `/gsd-*` slash commands written to `~/.codebuddy/commands/`
- **Augment** — `commands/gsd-<name>.md` written to `~/.augment/commands/`
- **Cursor** (Cursor >= 1.6) — `.cursor/commands/gsd-<name>.md` so GSD appears in the `/` command menu

**Cross-runtime lifecycle hooks (1.4.0):** Each supported runtime registers lifecycle hook events for per-turn context-headroom tracking and workflow state management. Notable registrations:
- **Claude Code:** `SubagentStop`, `Stop`, `PreCompact` (context-headroom warnings), `FileChanged` (hot-reloads `.planning/config.json` mid-session)
- **Gemini:** `BeforeAgent`, `AfterAgent`, `BeforeModel`
- **Qwen Code:** `SubagentStop`, `Stop`, `PreCompact`
- **Codex:** `SubagentStart`, `Stop`, `PostToolUse` (new in 1.4.0); on Windows the `SessionStart` hook entry gains a `commandWindows` field so the `.cmd` shim is used for native execution
- **Cline:** `PreToolUse`
- **Cursor:** `sessionStart` (injects workflow state), `postToolUse` (nudges `.planning` updates)
- **Copilot:** `sessionStart`

**Runtime-specific enrichments (1.4.0):**
- Codex emits `service_tier: flex` for light-tier agents; GSD skills appear in the Codex `/skills` picker via `SKILL.md` (no `agents/openai.yaml` sidecar is emitted — doing so caused duplicate autocomplete entries, #1326)
- Gemini commands use native `{{args}}` interpolation

**Native packaging:**
- **Claude Code:** GSD Core ships a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest, enabling installation and lifecycle management via `claude plugin install|enable|disable|update gsd-core`. Commands load under the `/gsd-core:` namespace (e.g. `/gsd-core:plan-phase`), avoiding slash-command collisions with the classic npm installer which uses `/gsd:`. Always-on guard and update hooks are wired automatically via `hooks/hooks.json`. The plugin path is additive — the npm installer (`npx @opengsd/gsd-core`) remains fully supported.
- **Gemini CLI:** Ships `gemini-extension.json`, enabling installation and lifecycle management via `gemini extensions install|update|uninstall|link`.

---

### 37. Hook System

**Purpose:** Runtime event hooks for context monitoring, status display, and update checking.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-HOOK-01: Statusline MUST display model, current task, directory, and context usage
- REQ-HOOK-02: Context monitor MUST inject agent-facing warnings at threshold levels
- REQ-HOOK-03: Update checker MUST run in background on session start
- REQ-HOOK-04: All hooks MUST respect `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var
- REQ-HOOK-05: All hooks MUST include 3-second stdin timeout guard
- REQ-HOOK-06: All hooks MUST fail silently on any error
- REQ-HOOK-07: Context usage MUST normalize for autocompact buffer (16.5% reserved)
- REQ-HOOK-08: Update banner MUST be opt-in and silent unless an update is available (PR #2795)

**Statusline Display:**
```text
[⬆ /gsd-update │] model │ [current task │] directory [█████░░░░░ 50%]
```

Color coding: <50% green, <65% yellow, <80% orange, ≥80% red with skull emoji

**Update Banner (opt-in, when GSD statusline isn't used):**

When the user declines (or keeps a non-GSD) statusline, the installer offers a SessionStart banner that surfaces update availability without occupying statusline real estate. The banner reads `~/.cache/gsd/gsd-update-check.json` (written by `gsd-check-update-worker.js`) and emits one line only when an update is available:

```text
GSD update available: 1.39.0 → 1.40.0. Run /gsd-update.
```

The banner is silent when up-to-date and rate-limits "check failed" diagnostics to once per 24 hours. Removed cleanly by `npx @opengsd/gsd-core --uninstall` or by deleting the SessionStart entry that references `gsd-update-banner.js`.

### 38. Developer Profiling

**Command:** `/gsd-profile-user [--questionnaire] [--refresh]`

**Purpose:** Analyze Claude Code session history to build behavioral profiles across 8 dimensions, generating artifacts that personalize Claude's responses to the developer's style.

**Dimensions:**
1. Communication style (terse vs verbose, formal vs casual)
2. Decision patterns (rapid vs deliberate, risk tolerance)
3. Debugging approach (systematic vs intuitive, log preference)
4. UX preferences (design sensibility, accessibility awareness)
5. Vendor/technology choices (framework preferences, ecosystem familiarity)
6. Frustration triggers (what causes friction in workflows)
7. Learning style (documentation vs examples, depth preference)
8. Explanation depth (high-level vs implementation detail)

**Generated Artifacts:**
- `USER-PROFILE.md` — Full behavioral profile with evidence citations
- `CLAUDE.md` profile section — Auto-discovered by Claude Code

**Flags:**
- `--questionnaire` — Interactive questionnaire fallback when session history is unavailable
- `--refresh` — Re-analyze sessions and regenerate profile

**Pipeline Modules:**
- `profile-pipeline.cjs` — Session scanning, message extraction, sampling
- `profile-output.cjs` — Profile rendering, questionnaire, artifact generation
- `gsd-user-profiler` agent — Behavioral analysis from session data

**Requirements:**
- REQ-PROF-01: Session analysis MUST cover at least 8 behavioral dimensions
- REQ-PROF-02: Profile MUST cite evidence from actual session messages
- REQ-PROF-03: Questionnaire MUST be available as fallback when no session history exists

### 39. Execution Hardening

**Purpose:** Three additive quality improvements to the execution pipeline that catch cross-plan failures before they cascade.

**Components:**

**1. Pre-Wave Dependency Check** (execute-phase)
Before spawning wave N+1, verify key-links from prior wave artifacts exist and are wired correctly. Catches cross-plan dependency gaps before they cascade into downstream failures.

**2. Cross-Plan Data Contracts — Dimension 9** (plan-checker)
New analysis dimension that checks plans sharing data pipelines have compatible transformations. Flags when one plan strips data that another plan needs in its original form.

**3. Export-Level Spot Check** (verify-phase)
After Level 3 wiring verification passes, spot-check individual exports for actual usage. Catches dead stores that exist in wired files but are never called.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-HARD-01: Pre-wave check MUST verify key-links from all prior wave artifacts before spawning next wave
- REQ-HARD-02: Cross-plan contract check MUST detect incompatible data transformations between plans
- REQ-HARD-03: Export spot-check MUST identify dead stores in wired files

### 40. Verification Debt Tracking

**Command:** `/gsd-audit-uat`

**Purpose:** Prevent silent loss of UAT/verification items when projects advance past phases with outstanding tests. Surfaces verification debt across all prior phases so items are never forgotten.

**Components:**

**1. Cross-Phase Health Check** (progress.md Step 1.6)
Every `/gsd-progress` call scans ALL phases in the current milestone for outstanding items (pending, skipped, blocked, human_needed). Displays a non-blocking warning section with actionable links.

**2. `status: partial`** (verify-work.md, UAT.md)
New UAT status that distinguishes between "session ended" and "all tests resolved". Prevents `status: complete` when tests are still pending, blocked, or skipped without reason.

**3. `result: blocked` with `blocked_by` tag** (verify-work.md, UAT.md)
New test result type for tests blocked by external dependencies (server, physical device, release build, third-party services). Categorized separately from skipped tests.

**4. HUMAN-UAT.md Persistence** (execute-phase.md)
When verification returns `human_needed`, items are persisted as a trackable HUMAN-UAT.md file with `status: partial`. Feeds into the cross-phase health check and audit systems.

**5. Phase Completion Warnings** (phase.cjs, transition.md)
`phase complete` CLI returns verification debt warnings in its JSON output. Transition workflow surfaces outstanding items before confirmation.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-DEBT-01: System MUST surface outstanding UAT/verification items from ALL prior phases in `/gsd-progress`
- REQ-DEBT-02: System MUST distinguish incomplete testing (partial) from completed testing (complete)

### 110. Cross-AI Execution Delegation

**Command:** `/gsd-execute-phase N --cross-ai`

**Purpose:** Delegate individual plans to an external AI runtime for execution. Plans with `cross_ai: true` in their frontmatter (or all plans when `--cross-ai` is used) are sent to the configured command via stdin. Successfully handled plans are removed from the normal executor queue.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-CROSSAI-01: `--cross-ai` forces all plans through cross-AI; `--no-cross-ai` disables it
- REQ-CROSSAI-02: `workflow.cross_ai_execution: true` and plan frontmatter `cross_ai: true` required for per-plan activation
- REQ-CROSSAI-03: Task prompt is piped via stdin to prevent injection
- REQ-CROSSAI-04: Dirty working tree produces a warning before execution
- REQ-CROSSAI-05: On failure, user chooses: retry, skip (fall back to normal executor), or abort

**Configuration:** `workflow.cross_ai_execution`, `workflow.cross_ai_command`, `workflow.cross_ai_timeout`

---

### 111. Architectural Responsibility Mapping

**Command:** `/gsd-plan-phase` (enhanced research step)

**Purpose:** During phase research, the phase-researcher now maps each capability to its architectural tier owner (browser, frontend server, API, CDN/static, database). The planner cross-references tasks against this map, and the plan-checker enforces tier compliance as Dimension 7c.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-ARM-01: Phase researcher produces an Architectural Responsibility Map table in RESEARCH.md (Step 1.5)
- REQ-ARM-02: Planner sanity-checks task-to-tier assignments against the map
- REQ-ARM-03: Plan checker validates tier compliance as Dimension 7c (WARNING for general mismatches, BLOCKER for security-sensitive ones)

**Produces:** `## Architectural Responsibility Map` section in `{phase}-RESEARCH.md`

---

### 112. Extract Learnings

**Command:** `/gsd-extract-learnings N`

**Purpose:** Extract structured knowledge from completed phase artifacts. Reads PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md (required) plus VERIFICATION.md, UAT.md, and STATE.md (optional) to produce four categories of learnings: decisions, lessons, patterns, and surprises. Optionally captures each item to an external knowledge base via `capture_thought` tool.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-LEARN-01: Requires PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md; exits with clear error if missing
- REQ-LEARN-02: Each extracted item includes source attribution (artifact and section)
- REQ-LEARN-03: If `capture_thought` tool is available, captures items with `source`, `project`, and `phase` metadata
- REQ-LEARN-04: If `capture_thought` is unavailable, completes successfully and logs that external capture was skipped
- REQ-LEARN-05: Running twice overwrites the previous `LEARNINGS.md`

**Produces:** `{phase}-LEARNINGS.md` with YAML frontmatter (phase, project, counts per category, missing_artifacts)

**Optional integration — `capture_thought`:** `capture_thought` is a **convention, not a bundled tool**. GSD does not ship one and does not require one. The workflow checks whether any MCP server in the current session exposes a tool named `capture_thought` and, if so, calls it once per extracted learning with the signature below. If no such tool is present, the step is skipped silently and `LEARNINGS.md` remains the primary output.

Expected tool signature:
```javascript
capture_thought({
  category: "decision" | "lesson" | "pattern" | "surprise",
  phase: <phase_number>,
  content: <learning_text>,
  source: <artifact_name>
})
```

Users who run a memory / knowledge-base MCP server (for example, ExoCortex-style servers, `claude-mem`, or `mem0`-style servers) can implement this tool name to have learnings routed into their knowledge base automatically with `project`, `phase`, and `source` metadata. Everyone else can use `/gsd-extract-learnings` without any extra setup — the `LEARNINGS.md` artifact is the feature.

---

### 114. Context-Window-Aware Prompt Thinning

**Purpose:** Reduce static prompt overhead by ~40% for models with context windows under 200K tokens. Extended examples and anti-pattern lists are extracted from agent definitions into reference files loaded on demand via `@` required_reading.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-THIN-01: When `CONTEXT_WINDOW < 200000`, executor and planner agent prompts omit inline examples
- REQ-THIN-02: Extracted content lives in `references/executor-examples.md` and `references/planner-antipatterns.md`
- REQ-THIN-03: Standard (200K-500K) and enriched (500K+) tiers are unaffected
- REQ-THIN-04: Core rules and decision logic remain inline; only verbose examples are extracted

**Reference files:** `executor-examples.md`, `planner-antipatterns.md`

---

### 115. Configurable CLAUDE.md Path

**Purpose:** Allow projects to store their CLAUDE.md in a non-root location. The `claude_md_path` config key controls where `/gsd-profile-user` and related commands write the generated CLAUDE.md file.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-CMDPATH-01: `claude_md_path` defaults to `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` (a valid project-scoped memory location; changed from `./CLAUDE.md` in v1.5 per [#1098](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/1098) so generated content does not pollute a hand-crafted repo-root `CLAUDE.md`)
- REQ-CMDPATH-02: Profile generation commands read the path from config and write to the specified location
- REQ-CMDPATH-03: Relative paths are resolved from the project root
- REQ-CMDPATH-04: `generate-claude-md` never overwrites an existing instruction file that lacks GSD section markers (a hand-crafted file) unless `--force` is passed

**Configuration:** `claude_md_path`

---

### 116. TDD Pipeline Mode

**Purpose:** Opt-in TDD (red-green-refactor) as a first-class phase execution mode. When enabled, the planner aggressively selects `type: tdd` for eligible tasks and the executor enforces RED/GREEN/REFACTOR gate sequence with fail-fast on unexpected GREEN before RED.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-TDD-01: `workflow.tdd_mode` config key (boolean, default `false`)
- REQ-TDD-02: When enabled, planner applies TDD heuristics from `references/tdd.md` to all eligible tasks (business logic, APIs, validations, algorithms, state machines)
- REQ-TDD-03: Executor enforces gate sequence for `type: tdd` plans — RED commit (`test(...)`) must precede GREEN commit (`feat(...)`)
- REQ-TDD-04: Executor fails fast if tests pass unexpectedly during RED phase (feature already exists or test is wrong)
- REQ-TDD-05: End-of-phase collaborative review checkpoint verifies gate compliance across all TDD plans (advisory, non-blocking)
- REQ-TDD-06: Gate violations surfaced in SUMMARY.md under `## TDD Gate Compliance` section

**Configuration:** `workflow.tdd_mode`
**Reference files:** `tdd.md`, `checkpoints.md`

---

## v1.37.0 Features

### 117. Spike Command

**Command:** `/gsd-spike [idea] [--quick]`

**Purpose:** Run 2–5 focused feasibility experiments before committing to an implementation approach. Each experiment uses Given/When/Then framing, produces executable code, and returns a VALIDATED / INVALIDATED / PARTIAL verdict. Companion `/gsd-spike --wrap-up` packages findings into a project-local skill.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-SPIKE-01: Each experiment MUST produce a Given/When/Then hypothesis before any code is written
- REQ-SPIKE-02: Each experiment MUST include working code or a minimal reproduction
- REQ-SPIKE-03: Each experiment MUST return one of: VALIDATED, INVALIDATED, or PARTIAL verdict with evidence
- REQ-SPIKE-04: Results MUST be stored in `.planning/spikes/NNN-experiment-name/` with a README and MANIFEST.md
- REQ-SPIKE-05: `--quick` flag skips intake conversation and uses the argument text as the experiment direction
- REQ-SPIKE-06: `/gsd-spike --wrap-up` MUST package findings into `.claude/skills/spike-findings-[project]/`

**Produces:**

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `.planning/spikes/NNN-name/README.md` | Hypothesis, experiment code, verdict, and evidence |
| `.planning/spikes/MANIFEST.md` | Index of all spikes with verdicts |
| `.claude/skills/spike-findings-[project]/` | Packaged findings (via `/gsd-spike --wrap-up`) |

---

### 118. Sketch Command

**Command:** `/gsd-sketch [idea] [--quick] [--text]`

**Purpose:** Explore design directions through throwaway HTML mockups before committing to implementation. Produces 2–3 interactive variants per design question, all viewable directly in a browser with no build step. Companion `/gsd-sketch --wrap-up` packages winning decisions into a project-local skill.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-SKETCH-01: Each sketch MUST answer one specific visual design question
- REQ-SKETCH-02: Each sketch MUST include 2–3 meaningfully different variants in a single `index.html` with tab navigation
- REQ-SKETCH-03: All interactive elements (hover, click, transitions) MUST be functional
- REQ-SKETCH-04: Sketches MUST use real-ish content, not lorem ipsum
- REQ-SKETCH-05: A shared `themes/default.css` MUST provide CSS variables adapted to the agreed aesthetic
- REQ-SKETCH-06: `--quick` flag skips mood intake; `--text` flag replaces `AskUserQuestion` with numbered lists for non-Claude runtimes
- REQ-SKETCH-07: The winning variant MUST be marked in the README frontmatter and with a ★ in the HTML tab
- REQ-SKETCH-08: `/gsd-sketch --wrap-up` MUST package winning decisions into `.claude/skills/sketch-findings-[project]/`

**Produces:**
| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `.planning/sketches/NNN-name/index.html` | 2–3 interactive HTML variants |
| `.planning/sketches/NNN-name/README.md` | Design question, variants, winner, what to look for |
| `.planning/sketches/themes/default.css` | Shared CSS theme variables |
| `.planning/sketches/MANIFEST.md` | Index of all sketches with winners |
| `.claude/skills/sketch-findings-[project]/` | Packaged decisions (via `/gsd-sketch --wrap-up`) |

---

### 119. Agent Size-Budget Enforcement

**Purpose:** Keep agent prompt files lean with tiered line-count limits enforced in CI. Oversized agents are caught before they bloat context windows in production.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-BUDGET-01: `agents/gsd-*.md` files are classified into three tiers: XL (≤ 1 600 lines), Large (≤ 1 000 lines), Default (≤ 500 lines)
- REQ-BUDGET-02: Tier assignment is declared in the file's YAML frontmatter (`size: xl | large | default`)
- REQ-BUDGET-03: `tests/agent-size-budget.test.cjs` enforces limits and fails CI on violation
- REQ-BUDGET-04: Files without a `size` frontmatter key default to the Default (500-line) limit

**Test file:** `tests/agent-size-budget.test.cjs`

---

### 120. Shared Boilerplate Extraction

**Purpose:** Reduce duplication across agents by extracting two common boilerplate blocks into shared reference files loaded on demand. Keeps agent files within size budget and makes boilerplate updates a single-file change.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-BOILER-01: Mandatory-initial-read instructions extracted to `references/mandatory-initial-read.md`
- REQ-BOILER-02: Project-skills-discovery instructions extracted to `references/project-skills-discovery.md`
- REQ-BOILER-03: Agents that previously inlined these blocks MUST now reference them via `@` required_reading

**Reference files:** `references/mandatory-initial-read.md`, `references/project-skills-discovery.md`

---

### 121. Knowledge Graph Integration

**Purpose:** Build, query, and inspect a lightweight knowledge graph of the project in `.planning/graphs/`. Opt-in per project. Exposed as the `/gsd-graphify` user-facing command and the `gsd-tools.cjs graphify …` programmatic verb family. Complements `/gsd-map-codebase --query` (snapshot-oriented) with a graph-oriented view of nodes and edges across commands, agents, workflows, and phases.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-GRAPH-01: Opt-in via `graphify.enabled: true` in `.planning/config.json`. When disabled, `/gsd-graphify` prints an activation hint and stops without writing.
- REQ-GRAPH-02: Slash-command `/gsd-graphify` exposes subcommands `build`, `query <term>`, `status`, `diff`. The programmatic CLI `node gsd-tools.cjs graphify …` additionally exposes `snapshot`, which is also invoked automatically as the final step of `graphify build`.
- REQ-GRAPH-03: Build runs within the configurable `graphify.build_timeout` (seconds); exceeding the timeout aborts cleanly without leaving a partial graph.
- REQ-GRAPH-04: `graphify.cjs` falls back to `graph.links` when `graph.edges` is absent so older graph artifacts keep rendering.
- REQ-GRAPH-05: Graphify is invoked through `gsd-tools.cjs graphify ...` command handlers.

**Configuration:** `graphify.enabled`, `graphify.build_timeout`
**Reference files:** `commands/gsd/graphify.md`, `bin/lib/graphify.cjs`

---

## v1.40.0 Features

### 122. Skill Surface Consolidation

**Purpose:** Cut the eager skill-listing overhead by folding 31 micro-skills into 4 new grouped parents and 6 existing parents that absorb sub-operations as flags. Zero functional loss — every removed micro-skill's behavior survives via a flag on a consolidated parent. After consolidation, `commands/gsd/*.md` ships 59 sub-skills (plus 6 namespace meta-skills, see #123).

**Requirements:**
- REQ-CONSOLIDATE-01: Four new grouped skills replace clusters of micro-skills:
  - `/gsd-capture` — folds add-todo (default), note (`--note`), add-backlog (`--backlog`), plant-seed (`--seed`), check-todos (`--list`)
  - `/gsd-phase` — folds add-phase (default), insert-phase (`--insert`), remove-phase (`--remove`), edit-phase (`--edit`)
  - `/gsd-config` — folds settings-advanced (`--advanced`), settings-integrations (`--integrations`), set-profile (`--profile`)
  - `/gsd-workspace` — folds new-workspace (`--new`), list-workspaces (`--list`), remove-workspace (`--remove`)
- REQ-CONSOLIDATE-02: Six existing parents absorb wrap-up / sub-operations as flags: `/gsd-update --sync`, `/gsd-update --reapply`, `/gsd-sketch --wrap-up`, `/gsd-spike --wrap-up`, `/gsd-map-codebase --fast`, `/gsd-map-codebase --query`, `/gsd-code-review --fix`, `/gsd-progress --do`, `/gsd-progress --next`.
- REQ-CONSOLIDATE-03: Deleted micro-skill slash forms (the bare `gsd-add-todo`, `gsd-add-backlog`, `gsd-plant-seed`, `gsd-check-todos`, `gsd-add-phase`, `gsd-insert-phase`, `gsd-remove-phase`, `gsd-edit-phase`, `gsd-new-workspace`, `gsd-list-workspaces`, `gsd-remove-workspace`, `gsd-settings-advanced`, `gsd-settings-integrations`, `gsd-set-profile`, `gsd-sketch-wrap-up`, `gsd-spike-wrap-up`, `gsd-reapply-patches`, `gsd-code-review-fix`, …) MUST resolve to "Unknown command" — no shadow stubs.
- REQ-CONSOLIDATE-04: `autonomous.md` invokes `/gsd-code-review --fix` (was previously calling the deleted `gsd-code-review-fix`).

**Reference issue:** [#2790](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2790)

---

### 123. Namespace Meta-Skills (Two-Stage Routing)

**Purpose:** Replace the flat eager skill listing with a two-stage hierarchical routing layer. The model sees 6 namespace routers instead of 86 entries, selects a namespace, then routes to the sub-skill. Descriptions use pipe-separated keyword tags (≤ 60 chars) for routing density.

**Commands:**
- `/gsd-workflow` — phase pipeline router (discuss / plan / execute / verify / phase / progress)
- `/gsd-project` — project lifecycle (milestones, audits, summary)
- `/gsd-quality` — quality gates (code review, debug, audit, security, eval, ui)
- `/gsd-context` — codebase intelligence (map, graphify, docs, learnings)
- `/gsd-manage` — config / workspace / workstreams / thread / update / ship / inbox
- `/gsd-ideate` — exploration & capture (explore, sketch, spike, spec, capture)

**Token cost:**

| | Entries | Approx tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-1.40 full install | 86 | ~2,150 |
| Namespace meta-skills | 6 | ~120 |

**Requirements:**
- REQ-NS-01: Six `commands/gsd/ns-*.md` namespace routers ship with pipe-separated keyword-tag descriptions (≤ 60 chars).
- REQ-NS-02: Existing sub-skills are unchanged and still invocable directly — namespace skills are additive, not a replacement for direct slash forms.
- REQ-NS-03: The body of each namespace router contains a routing table that maps user intent to the correct concrete sub-skill on the post-#2790 consolidated surface.

**Reference issue:** [#2792](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2792)

---

### 124. Context-Window Utilization Guard

**Command:** `/gsd-health --context`

**Purpose:** Quality guard against context-window saturation. Two thresholds: 60 % utilization warns ("consider `/gsd-thread`"), 70 % is critical ("reasoning quality may degrade"; matches the fracture-point per recent context-attention research).

**Requirements:**
- REQ-CTX-GUARD-01: `/gsd-health --context` prints a structured status line with current utilization, threshold tier (`ok` / `warn` / `critical`), and a remediation suggestion.
- REQ-CTX-GUARD-02: The same triage is exposed as `gsd-tools.cjs validate context --tokens-used <int> --context-window <int>` — a structured envelope for status-line and hook callers (#125). Both flags are required; the handler returns the same `{ percent, state }` envelope as the pure classifier in REQ-CTX-GUARD-03.
- REQ-CTX-GUARD-03: The classifier (`bin/lib/context-utilization.cjs`) is pure: input `(tokensUsed, contextWindow)`, output `{ percent, state }`. Easy to unit-test, easy to reuse from any caller.

**Reference issue:** [#2792](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2792)

---

### 125. Phase-Lifecycle Status-Line Read-Side

**Purpose:** Surface phase orchestration state on the status-line. `parseStateMd()` reads four new STATE.md frontmatter fields and `formatGsdState()` renders in-flight, idle, and progress scenes. Write-side wiring follows in a later RC.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-LIFECYCLE-01: `parseStateMd()` reads four optional fields:
  - `active_phase` — phase number when an orchestrator is in flight
  - `next_action` — recommended next command when idle
  - `next_phases` — YAML flow array of next phase numbers
  - `progress` — nested `total_phases` / `completed_phases` / `percent` block
- REQ-LIFECYCLE-02: `formatGsdState()` checks the lifecycle fields in priority order and emits the first matching scene (Phase active → Idle next-recommended → Milestone complete → Default fallback).
- REQ-LIFECYCLE-03: All four fields default to undefined; existing STATE.md files render byte-for-byte identically.

**Reference issue:** [#2833](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2833) — see [`docs/STATE-MD-LIFECYCLE.md`](reference/state-md.md) for the full field reference and rendering rules.

---

## v1.41.0 Features

### 126. Per-Phase-Type Model Selection

**Purpose:** Express model tuning at the phase level (planning, research, execution, verification) without learning the full agent taxonomy. Sits between per-agent `model_overrides` (precise, verbose) and the global `model_profile` tier (coarse, uniform).

**Config key:** `models` in `.planning/config.json`

**Phase-type slots:**

| Slot | Agents assigned |
|------|-----------------|
| `planning` | `gsd-planner`, `gsd-roadmapper`, `gsd-pattern-mapper` |
| `discuss` | (reserved for future subagent) |
| `research` | `gsd-phase-researcher`, `gsd-project-researcher`, `gsd-research-synthesizer`, `gsd-codebase-mapper`, `gsd-ui-researcher` |
| `execution` | `gsd-executor`, `gsd-debugger`, `gsd-doc-writer` |
| `verification` | `gsd-verifier`, `gsd-plan-checker`, `gsd-integration-checker`, `gsd-nyquist-auditor`, `gsd-ui-checker`, `gsd-ui-auditor`, `gsd-doc-verifier` |
| `completion` | (reserved for future subagent) |

**Accepted values:** `"opus"` / `"sonnet"` / `"haiku"` / `"inherit"`

**Resolution precedence (highest → lowest):**

```text
1. model_overrides[<agent>]
2. dynamic_routing.tier_models[<tier>]   (when enabled)
3. models[<phase_type>]                  (this feature)
4. model_profile
5. Runtime default
```

**Requirements:**
- REQ-PHASE-MODELS-01: Six named `models.*` slots accepted by `config-schema.cjs` and `config-schema.ts`; `config-set` rejects unknown phase-types.
- REQ-PHASE-MODELS-02: Configs without a `models` block behave byte-for-byte identically to pre-v1.41 behavior.
- REQ-PHASE-MODELS-03: `discuss` and `completion` are accepted by the schema for forward compatibility; setting them today is a no-op until a subagent maps to each.

**Reference issue:** [#3023](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/pull/3030)

---

### 127. Dynamic Routing with Failure-Tier Escalation

**Purpose:** Pay for the cheap tier by default; escalate to a more capable model automatically when the orchestrator detects a soft failure (verification inconclusive, plan-check FLAG, etc.).

**Config key:** `dynamic_routing` in `.planning/config.json`

**Behavior:**
- `enabled: false` (default) — feature is off; all agents use the precedence chain unchanged.
- `enabled: true` — the resolver picks `tier_models[default_tier]` for the first spawn and escalates one tier up on orchestrator-detected soft failure, capped by `max_escalations`.

**Composition:** `model_overrides` always wins; `dynamic_routing.tier_models[<tier>]` resolves above `models.<phase_type>` and `model_profile`.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-DYNROUTE-01: `dynamic_routing.enabled` acts as a master switch; when `false` or block is absent, zero behavior change.
- REQ-DYNROUTE-02: New resolver `resolveModelForTier(cwd, agent, attempt)` in `core.cjs` is the single call-site for orchestrator integration.
- REQ-DYNROUTE-03: `max_escalations` caps the escalation chain to prevent runaway cost.

**Reference issue:** [#3024](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/pull/3031)

---

### 128. Update Banner Opt-In

**Purpose:** Surface update availability to users who have declined or bypassed the GSD statusline, without requiring the statusline.

**Behavior:**
- At install time, if the installer detects no GSD statusline, it offers an opt-in `SessionStart` hook.
- The hook reads the existing `~/.cache/gsd/gsd-update-check.json` cache — the same cache used by the statusline — and prints a banner only when an update is available.
- Silent when up-to-date.
- Failure diagnostics rate-limited to once per 24 h.
- Cleanly removed by `npx @opengsd/gsd-core --uninstall`.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-BANNER-01: Banner does not install without explicit opt-in.
- REQ-BANNER-02: No additional network requests — reuses the existing background update-check cache.
- REQ-BANNER-03: Uninstall path removes the banner hook.

**Reference issue:** [#2795](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/pull/2795)

---

### 129. Issue-Driven Orchestration Guide

**Purpose:** Document a recipe for driving the full GSD workflow from a GitHub / Linear / Jira issue, mapping tracker-centric concepts onto existing GSD primitives.

**Document:** [`docs/issue-driven-orchestration.md`](issue-driven-orchestration.md)

**Covered workflow:**
1. Create an isolated workspace per issue (`/gsd-workspace --new`)
2. Run the manager dashboard to get oriented (`/gsd-manager`)
3. Execute autonomously (`/gsd-autonomous`)
4. Verify and review (`/gsd-verify-work`, `/gsd-review`)
5. Ship and close the issue (`/gsd-ship`)

No new commands or daemon process — purely a documentation artifact that maps existing primitives onto a tracker-driven workflow.

**Reference issue:** [#2840](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/pull/2840)

---

### 130. Graphify Commit-Based Staleness

**Purpose:** Surface whether the architecture graph was built from the current commit or an older one, complementing the existing mtime-based stale signal.

**Command:** `/gsd-graphify status`

**New fields returned (graphify v0.7+ graphs):**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `built_at_commit` | string | Commit SHA the graph was built from |
| `current_commit` | string | Current `git HEAD` |
| `commits_behind` | number | How many commits behind HEAD the graph is |
| `commit_stale` | boolean \| null | `true`=stale, `false`=current, `null`=unavailable (pre-v0.7, non-git) |

**Rendered output (when signal is available):**
```
Source commit: abc1234 (3 commits behind HEAD)
```

**Security:** `built_at_commit` validated as 4–40 hex chars before reaching `git` — a hostile `graph.json` cannot inject dashed options into argv.

**Fallback:** pre-v0.7 graphs and non-git checkouts return `commit_stale: null`; callers fall back to the existing mtime-based `stale` flag. No behavior change for existing users.

**Reference issue:** [#3170](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/3170)

---

## v1.42.1 Features

### 132. Package Legitimacy Gate

**Purpose:** Stop hallucinated, suspicious, or slopsquatting package names before they reach a shell install command.

**Behavior:**
- Phase research writes a `## Package Legitimacy Audit` table for recommended packages.
- Packages verified only through search are treated as `[ASSUMED]`, not trusted.
- `[SLOP]` packages are removed from recommendations.
- Plans that need `[ASSUMED]` or suspicious packages add a human verification checkpoint.
- Executor install failures stop for human verification instead of auto-trying similarly named packages.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-PKG-GATE-01: Research MUST record package registry, age, download/source signals, slopcheck verdict, and disposition.
- REQ-PKG-GATE-02: Planner MUST gate unverified or suspicious package installs before execution.
- REQ-PKG-GATE-03: Executor MUST NOT auto-substitute package names after failed package-manager installs.

**Reference:** [v1.42.1 Release Notes](RELEASE-NOTES-LEGACY.md)

---

### 133. Skill Surface Budgeting

**Purpose:** Let users reduce installed skill and agent surface area when context budget matters.

**Install profiles:**
| Profile | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `core` | Minimal main-loop surface |
| `standard` | Core plus common phase-management commands |
| `full` | Complete surface; default |

**Runtime control:** `/gsd:surface` lists profile state and enables, disables, or resets skill clusters without reinstalling.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-SURFACE-01: Installer MUST resolve `--profile=<name>` and persist the active profile in `.gsd-profile`.
- REQ-SURFACE-02: `--minimal` and `--core-only` MUST remain aliases for `--profile=core`.
- REQ-SURFACE-03: Runtime surface state MUST persist outside the install profile marker.

**Reference:** [ADR-0011](adr/0011-skill-surface-budget-module.md)

---

### 134. Installer Migrations

**Purpose:** Make runtime config cleanup explicit, auditable, and rollback-aware during installs and updates.

**Capabilities:**
- First-time baseline migration records managed files.
- Legacy stale-file cleanup uses ownership evidence before deleting or rewriting.
- User-owned artifacts are preserved.
- Ambiguous GSD-looking files block with a clear report instead of being silently overwritten.
- Migration plans support dry-run reporting and rollback protection.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-INSTALL-MIGRATION-01: Migration records MUST include metadata, install scope, and ownership evidence.
- REQ-INSTALL-MIGRATION-02: Destructive actions MUST fail closed when ownership is ambiguous.
- REQ-INSTALL-MIGRATION-03: Install failures MUST restore the pre-install state when rollback data exists.

**Reference:** [Installer Migrations](installer-migrations.md)

---

### 135. Custom Ship PR Body Sections

**Command:** `/gsd-ship`

**Config key:** `ship.pr_body_sections`

**Purpose:** Add project-specific PRD-style sections to generated PR bodies without editing GSD workflow files.

**Behavior:** Configured sections append after the required `Summary`, `Changes`, `Requirements Addressed`, `Verification`, and `Key Decisions` sections. They can copy from artifact headings, render templates, or fall back to static text.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-SHIP-SECTIONS-01: Custom sections MUST NOT replace, remove, or reorder required PR sections.
- REQ-SHIP-SECTIONS-02: Unknown template tokens MUST be rejected by config validation.
- REQ-SHIP-SECTIONS-03: Disabled sections MUST stay in config without appearing in PR output.

**Reference:** [Custom PR Body Sections](ship-pr-body-sections.md)

---

### 136. Review Default Reviewers

**Command:** `/gsd-review`

**Config key:** `review.default_reviewers`

**Purpose:** Let teams choose the default reviewer subset for no-flag `/gsd-review` runs.

**Precedence:**
```text
explicit reviewer flags -> --all -> review.default_reviewers -> all detected reviewers
```

**Requirements:**
- REQ-REVIEW-DEFAULTS-01: Missing `review.default_reviewers` MUST preserve the previous all-detected behavior.
- REQ-REVIEW-DEFAULTS-02: Empty arrays MUST be rejected; remove the key to restore all-detected behavior.
- REQ-REVIEW-DEFAULTS-03: Known but unavailable reviewers MUST be skipped with diagnostics rather than hard-failing the run.

### 137. Fallow Structural Review Pre-Pass

**Command:** `/gsd-code-review`

**Config keys:** `code_quality.fallow.*`

**Purpose:** Add an optional structural analysis pass before the agent review.

**Behavior:** When enabled, GSD resolves a `fallow` binary, runs a bounded audit, writes `FALLOW.json`, and embeds structural findings in `REVIEW.md`.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-FALLOW-01: Fallow MUST be opt-in and disabled by default.
- REQ-FALLOW-02: Missing or failing fallow runs MUST produce clear diagnostics.
- REQ-FALLOW-03: Findings larger than the embed budget MUST be skipped with a warning, preserving the raw JSON artifact.

**Reference:** [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md#code-quality-settings)

### 138. End-of-Phase Human Verification Mode

**Config key:** `workflow.human_verify_mode`

**Purpose:** Reduce mid-flight human checkpoint interruptions while preserving human verification requirements.

**Behavior:** The default `"end-of-phase"` mode embeds human checks into `<verify><human-check>` blocks for phase review. `"mid-flight"` restores blocking `checkpoint:human-verify` tasks.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-HUMAN-VERIFY-01: `checkpoint:decision` and `checkpoint:human-action` MUST remain blocking regardless of mode.
- REQ-HUMAN-VERIFY-02: Human-needed verification MUST remain pending until the end-of-phase review resolves it.
- REQ-HUMAN-VERIFY-03: Configs without the key MUST use `"end-of-phase"`.

**Reference:** [Checkpoints Reference](../gsd-core/references/checkpoints.md)

---

### 139. Quota and Rate-Limit Failure Classification

**Command:** `/gsd-execute-phase`

**Purpose:** Treat provider quota and rate-limit failures as wait-and-resume conditions, not normal executor failures.

**Behavior:** Agent output is classified for signals such as `429`, `rate limit`, `usage limit`, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, and `usage_limit_reached`. Matching failures present a wait-for-reset recovery path.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-QUOTA-01: Quota failures MUST NOT offer immediate retry as the primary recovery.
- REQ-QUOTA-02: Classification MUST cover Claude, Copilot, Codex, Gemini, and generic provider sentinels.
- REQ-QUOTA-03: Non-quota failures MUST continue through the normal execution failure path.

**Reference:** [Provider Rate Limit Signals](research/provider-rate-limit-signals.md)

---

### 140. Statusline Context Position

**Config key:** `statusline.context_position`

**Purpose:** Keep the context meter visible in narrow terminals.

**Options:**
| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"end"` | Default; render context meter near the line tail |
| `"front"` | Render context meter immediately after the model name |

**Requirements:**
- REQ-STATUSLINE-POS-01: Invalid values MUST be rejected by config validation.
- REQ-STATUSLINE-POS-02: Missing config MUST preserve existing end-position rendering.

**Reference:** [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md#statusline-settings)

---

### 141. Milestone Tag Creation Toggle

**Command:** `/gsd-complete-milestone`

**Config key:** `git.create_tag`

**Purpose:** Let projects with external release automation complete milestones without creating local git tags.

**Behavior:** `git.create_tag: false` skips milestone tag creation. The workflow still updates milestone artifacts and state.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-MILESTONE-TAG-01: Missing config MUST preserve automatic tag creation.
- REQ-MILESTONE-TAG-02: Existing tag collisions MUST fail clearly instead of overwriting tags.
- REQ-MILESTONE-TAG-03: Disabling tag creation MUST NOT skip milestone archival.

**Reference:** [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md#git-branching)

---

### 142. Structured JSON Error Mode

**CLI:** `gsd-tools --json-errors`

**Purpose:** Give automation callers stable machine-readable error envelopes.

**Behavior:** Commands that fail under `--json-errors` return structured `ok: false` payloads with error kind, message, command context, and exit mapping instead of prose-only stderr.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-JSON-ERRORS-01: Unknown commands, validation errors, timeouts, native failures, fallback failures, and internal errors MUST map to canonical error kinds.
- REQ-JSON-ERRORS-02: CLI exit code mapping MUST remain stable for automation callers.
- REQ-JSON-ERRORS-03: Human-readable output MUST remain the default when `--json-errors` is absent.

---

### 143. UAT-Passed Predicate

**CLI:** `node gsd-tools.cjs phase uat-passed <N> [--require-verification]`

**Purpose:** Provide a runtime-neutral, automatable predicate that evaluates HUMAN-UAT results for a phase and returns a structured pass/fail verdict with full diagnostic detail.

**Behavior:** Locates `*-UAT.md` and optionally `*-VERIFICATION.md` files for the given phase, parses UAT test blocks (heading-block parser, column-0 result lines) with a markdown-aware stripper that removes false-positive contexts (YAML frontmatter, fenced code blocks, HTML comments, and blockquotes). Returns `passed: true` only when at least one check exists AND all checks pass AND no blockers — fail-closed, no vacuous pass. The `--require-verification` flag requires at least one `*-VERIFICATION.md` with an allowlisted passing status; the command fails without one.

**Output envelope:** `{ passed, uat_files[], verification_files[], checks[], blockers[], no_uat_artifacts, policy: { require_verification } }`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `passed` | `boolean` | `true` only when ≥1 check exists AND all passing AND no blockers |
| `uat_files` | `string[]` | Filenames of `*-UAT.md` files evaluated |
| `verification_files` | `string[]` | Filenames of `*-VERIFICATION.md` files evaluated |
| `checks[]` | `{ file, test, name, result, passing }[]` | Per-item results from heading blocks |
| `blockers[]` | `string[]` | Human-readable failure reasons (frontmatter, failing/missing items, policy, malformed markdown) |
| `no_uat_artifacts` | `boolean` | `true` when no test items were parsed; `passed` is always `false` when `true` |
| `policy.require_verification` | `boolean` | Whether `--require-verification` was active |

**Requirements:**
- REQ-UAT-PRED-01: The predicate MUST ignore result lines inside YAML frontmatter, fenced code blocks, HTML comments, and blockquotes.
- REQ-UAT-PRED-02: `passed: true` MUST require at least one check AND all checks passing AND no blockers (fail-closed, no vacuous pass).
- REQ-UAT-PRED-03: `--require-verification` MUST cause the command to fail when no `*-VERIFICATION.md` file with an allowlisted passing status is found.
- REQ-UAT-PRED-04: `blockers[]` contains all human-readable failure reasons including frontmatter issues, policy violations, and malformed markdown — NOT limited to a subset of `checks[]`.
- REQ-UAT-PRED-05: The module MUST be runtime-neutral (no runtime-specific env checks or exit shortcuts).
- REQ-UAT-PRED-06: A heading block with no column-0 `result:` line emits `result:'missing'` (blocker); test items are never silently dropped.

### 144. Spec-Phase Edge-Completeness Probe

**Command:** `/gsd-spec-phase`

**Purpose:** Surface the omitted domain-boundary edges that silently invalidate a requirement — touching intervals, empty inputs, rounding ties, grapheme truncation — before they become production defects. Runs as `Step 5.5` of spec-phase, after the ambiguity gate.

**Behavior:** For each SPEC requirement the probe classifies its data/behavior shape, then raises only the *applicable* categories from a closed 8-category taxonomy (boundary, adjacency, empty, encoding, ordering, precision, idempotency, concurrency) via a relevance filter. Each raised category proposes one concrete candidate edge, which the author resolves to exactly one of four states:

| State | Meaning | Downstream effect |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `covered` | An acceptance criterion handles the edge | Pass/fail line written into the SPEC Acceptance Criteria block; lifted into `plan-phase` `must_haves.truths` |
| `dismissed` | The edge cannot occur (requires a non-empty reason) | Recorded with its reason; empty dismissals are rejected |
| `backstop` | Intent recorded, needs a held-out/property-based test | Lifted into `must_haves.truths` as a non-inferable check |
| `unresolved` | Deferred | Soft-gates the spec; row stamped `⚠ Edge unresolved — planner must treat as assumption` |

When a requirement's prose matches **no** shape cue, the probe does not silently drop it (#1110): it emits a single `unclassified — review manually` candidate so the zero-cue requirement is surfaced for the author to resolve like any other (specify / dismiss-with-reason / defer) — a manual-review nudge, not a hard block.

The resolved edges populate a `## Edge Coverage` section in `SPEC.md`. Unresolved *applicable* edges trigger a soft gate (Resolve / Write-anyway-flagged / Keep-probing) rather than a hard block. Under `--auto`, the probe **never auto-dismisses** — it auto-covers where a defensible criterion exists, otherwise auto-backstops, and logs `[auto] edge coverage: C covered, B backstop, U unresolved`. The one exception is an `unclassified` candidate: `--auto` leaves it **`unresolved`** (surfaced as a flagged assumption), never auto-`backstop` — a missing shape is not evidence an edge exists, so minting a held-out edge obligation would be a false claim.

The load-bearing wire is the `plan-phase` lift: `covered` and `backstop` edges become `must_haves.truths` the verifier can check, so the section is not merely documentation.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-EDGE-01: The edge pass MUST run after the ambiguity gate and emit a `## Edge Coverage` SPEC section.
- REQ-EDGE-02: The relevance filter MUST raise only applicable categories; each raised edge resolves to exactly one of covered/dismissed/backstop/unresolved.
- REQ-EDGE-03: A `dismissed` resolution MUST require a non-empty reason.
- REQ-EDGE-04: An unresolved applicable edge MUST trigger the soft gate; write-anyway stamps the row as a planner assumption.
- REQ-EDGE-05: `--auto` MUST never auto-dismiss — auto-cover or auto-backstop only.
- REQ-EDGE-06: `plan-phase` MUST lift `covered` criteria and `backstop` notes into `must_haves.truths`.
- REQ-EDGE-07: A requirement whose prose matches no shape cue MUST surface an `unclassified — review manually` candidate (never silently dropped); `--auto` MUST leave it `unresolved`, never auto-`backstop`.

## v1.43.0 Features

### 145. MemPalace Memory Capability

**Purpose:** Opt-in cross-session and cross-project memory via the [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) external service (local-first, MCP + CLI). Wires deliberate recall before discuss/plan and verbatim capture + temporal-KG sync at phase boundaries through the ADR-857 capability mechanism. Default-resilient: disabled by default, every hook is `onError: skip`, and an absent MemPalace installation leaves the loop unchanged.

**Commands:** `/gsd-mempalace-recall`, `/gsd-mempalace-capture`

**Requirements:**
- REQ-MP-01: Opt-in via `mempalace.enabled: true`. Default `false` — the loop is unchanged when unset.
- REQ-MP-02: At `plan:pre`, skill `mempalace-recall` produces `MEMORY-RECALL.md` from prior decisions, patterns, and surprises retrieved via wake-up + semantic search + KG timeline. When MemPalace is unreachable, writes an "unavailable" stub and continues.
- REQ-MP-03: At `discuss:post`, `plan:post`, and `verify:post`, skill `mempalace-capture` files the phase artifact verbatim into the appropriate MemPalace room (`decisions`, `planning`, `milestones`). Capture is idempotent via `mempalace_check_duplicate`.
- REQ-MP-04: At `ship:post`, agent `gsd-mempalace-curator` writes a diary entry, proposes cross-project tunnels (when `mempalace.cross_project_tunnels: true`), and runs wing-scoped sync pruning.
- REQ-MP-05: `mempalace.memory_mode` declares three values: `augment` (default, **implemented** — palace is an additional recall layer alongside GSD native memory), `kg_backend` (**forward-declared; routing seam not yet implemented** — selecting this today behaves identically to `augment`), `replace` (**forward-declared; not yet functional** — selecting this today behaves identically to `augment`). Only `augment` has effect in the current release.
- REQ-MP-06: Every hook is `onError: skip`. No hook carries `blocking: true`. Memory never halts or fails a phase.
- REQ-MP-07: Interactive runs prefer MCP tools; headless/cron runs prefer the MemPalace CLI (`mempalace wake-up`, `mempalace search`, `mempalace mine`, `mempalace sync`).
- REQ-MP-08: `mempalace.auto_capture_hooks` is **forward-declared and not yet functional**. No native Claude Code hooks (`stop`, `precompact`, `session-start`) are installed by this key; the capability's hooks array is empty. This key is reserved for the future "Connected Capability" phase. Default `false`.

**Configuration:** `mempalace.enabled`, `mempalace.memory_mode`, `mempalace.wing`, `mempalace.recall_on_discuss`, `mempalace.recall_on_plan`, `mempalace.capture_artifacts`, `mempalace.mirror_kg`, `mempalace.cross_project_tunnels`, `mempalace.diary_journal`, `mempalace.auto_capture_hooks`

See [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md#mempalace-settings) for full schema and [How to enable cross-session memory with MemPalace](how-to/enable-cross-session-memory-with-mempalace.md) for a setup walkthrough.

### 146. Spec-Phase Prohibition Probe

**Command:** `/gsd-spec-phase`

**Purpose:** Surface the unwritten *must-NOT* constraints — the values/safety/ethics interpretations a feature could silently become that the author would never want but the spec does not forbid — before any code is written. The edge probe reaches data-shape edges; it structurally cannot reach prohibitions. This is the missing instrument, running as `Step 5.6` of spec-phase, after the edge probe.

**Behavior:** A two-stage, prose-orchestrated pass per requirement (no compiled recall engine — recall is inherently model-driven, ADR-550 D7b):

1. **Recall (adversarial probe):** *"What could this feature silently become that the author would NOT want, but the spec does not forbid?"* — model-robust open-vocabulary elicitation across values/safety/ethics.
2. **Precision (one-pass classifier):** drop routine-engineering items, keep genuine values/safety/ethics prohibitions — collapses the raw list to the load-bearing few.

Each surfaced prohibition is resolved to exactly one of three states:

| State | Meaning | Downstream effect |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `resolved` | Confirmed a real must-NOT | NEGATIVE acceptance criterion written into the SPEC `## Prohibitions (must-NOT)` section; lifted into `plan-phase` `must_haves.prohibitions` (its own sibling block, never `truths`) |
| `dismissed` | Not a genuine prohibition (requires a non-empty reason) | Recorded with its reason; empty dismissals are rejected |
| `unresolved` | Deferred | Soft-gates the spec; surfaced as a planner assumption |

Each resolved prohibition carries a `verification` tier — `test` (a negative test can enforce it) or `judgment` (only human/LLM judgment can). At verify time, judgment-tier prohibitions route to a never-silent / never-hard-halt soft gate (autonomous emits an `unverified-prohibition — human review recommended` flag); test-tier prohibitions are enforced via the deterministic `check prohibition-enforcement` gate — green when the wired negative test / lint rule passes, hard-gate (flagged, non-green) when missing or failing, in both interactive and autonomous modes (#1259, ADR-550 D5d). Under `--auto`, the probe **never auto-dismisses**. Canon-bound concerns (OWASP / GDPR / fairness) are referred to `/gsd:secure-phase` rather than minting SPEC prohibitions (ADR-550 D6).

The load-bearing wire is the `plan-phase` lift into `must_haves.prohibitions`, so the section is not merely documentation.

**Deterministic prohibition-check descriptor source (#1278).** A resolved `test`-tier prohibition MAY carry an optional **`check` descriptor** — the flat-scalar keys `check_kind` (`node-test` | `lint-rule`), `check_target`, and `check_rule` (lint-rule only) — authored at spec-phase. `projectProhibitions` projects these scalars deterministically and verify-phase reads them back to locate the check handed to `check prohibition-enforcement`, so a wired, passing test closes the gap with **zero manual descriptor authoring** (previously the verify-phase LLM had to invent `{kind, target, rule}` each run, #1259). The descriptor is **optional and backward-compatible** — a descriptor-less prohibition parses and disposes byte-identically to today — and **fail-closed**: a partial, invalid, or absent descriptor falls through to the producer's existing fail-closed locate, never a silent green. `failFirst` stays a verify-time caller attestation (machine-proven fail-first is tracked in #1279).

**Requirements:**
- REQ-PROHIB-01: The prohibition pass MUST run after the edge probe and emit a `## Prohibitions (must-NOT)` SPEC section.
- REQ-PROHIB-02: Stage 1 MUST ask the adversarial recall question; Stage 2 MUST drop routine-engineering items and keep values/safety/ethics prohibitions.
- REQ-PROHIB-03: A `dismissed` resolution MUST require a non-empty reason.
- REQ-PROHIB-04: `--auto` MUST never auto-dismiss.
- REQ-PROHIB-05: `plan-phase` MUST lift resolved prohibitions into `must_haves.prohibitions` (never `truths`).
- REQ-PROHIB-06: A well-formed but unwired `test`-tier prohibition MUST fail closed at verify time — never a silent pass.
- REQ-PROHIB-07: A `test`-tier prohibition with a **machine-proven-fail-first**, genuinely-passing (non-vacuous) wired mechanical check (a `node --test` negative test OR a lint/AST rule) MUST dispose green and be satisfiable; a missing, un-provable, or non-passing check MUST hard-gate (flagged, non-green) in both interactive and autonomous modes. Fail-first is **machine-proven, not caller-attested** (#1279, ADR-550 D5d): before a clean pass greens, the producer independently runs the wired check against a known violation (the descriptor's `violationFixture`) and confirms it goes RED — a lint rule via the violating fixture, a node test via the violating subject injected through the `GSD_PROHIB_SUBJECT` convention; absent a violation source it fails closed, never falling back to attestation. (Enforcement half shipped #1259; deterministic descriptor auto-locate in #1278.)

### 147. Capability Management Command

**Command:** `gsd capability install | update | remove | list | outdated | disable | enable`

**Purpose:** The user-facing CLI for the ADR-1244 capability ecosystem — install, upgrade, remove, list, check for updates, and toggle GSD capabilities (first-party and third-party overlays) from a registry / git / npm / tarball / local source. Wires the Phase-3/4 lifecycle library (source resolver, install ledger, trust gate) to a command users actually run.

**Behavior:**
- `install <spec> [--integrity sha512-…] [--scope global|project] [--yes] [--shared-file <rel>]…` — resolve (copy-only) → verify integrity / SHA pin → `engines.gsd` gate → disclose executable surfaces → consent (`--yes` grants; without it an executable install aborts after printing the disclosure and writes nothing) → validate → extract → record the ledger.
- `update [<id> | --all] [--scope] [--yes]` — re-resolve the capability's recorded source and upgrade via atomic stage-then-swap; re-consent when the executable set changed; `--all` reports a per-capability outcome and exits non-zero on any partial failure.
- `remove <id> [--purge-data] [--scope]` — strip the ledger-recorded files + marker-isolated shared edits; first-party capabilities are rejected (use the product uninstaller).
- `list [--json]` — first-party + installed overlay capabilities (both scopes) as a JSON array.
- `outdated [--json] [--scope]` — light remote peek of each installed overlay's recorded source (ADR-1244 D6 per-source matrix: git `ls-remote --tags`, npm `view … version` resolving the highest version matching the recorded range, local re-read; tarball → `manual`, registry → `unknown`) reporting `outdated` / `current` / `pinned` / `manual` / `unknown` per capability. A source pinned to an immutable ref (git `#sha:` or `#tag:`, or an exact npm version) is reported `pinned`. A bare git `#<ref>` is classified at the remote: if it resolves exclusively under `refs/tags/` it is an immutable tag → `pinned`; if it resolves to a mutable branch (or is ambiguous) it is `unknown`. Bounded subprocesses (git ≤30s, npm ≤60s) and a failing peek degrades that row to `unknown` without crashing the command. `--json` for machine output, default for a table.
- `disable | enable <id>` — toggle activation state (equivalent to `gsd capability set <id> --off` / `--on`).

**Trust boundary:** install never executes capability code (copy-only staging); executable surfaces require explicit consent; sources are gated by the **project-scoped** `capabilities.strict_known_registries` policy (fail-closed on a malformed/unparseable value); every shared-config write/delete is realpath-confined to the scope root, and a name collision with a user's `mcpServers` entry is never clobbered.
