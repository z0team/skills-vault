# Planning artifacts reference

The `.planning/` directory is GSD Core's shared memory for a project. Every workflow reads from it, writes to it, and leaves an auditable trail of decisions. This page maps every file, its purpose, and which command produces or consumes it. See [docs index](../README.md).

## Root-level artifacts

### `PROJECT.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Canonical project identity: what it is, who it is for, core value, requirements, constraints, and key decisions. Updated throughout the project lifecycle as the product evolves. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-new-project` (initial creation); updated by `/gsd-complete-milestone` as decisions are validated. |
| **Consumed by** | All planning workflows; `gsd-phase-researcher`, `gsd-planner` (context); `discuss-phase` (prior decisions); `gsd-plan-checker` (project constraints). |

Includes an optional `## Business Context` section (Customer, Revenue model, Success metric, Strategy notes) for monetized or customer-facing projects — four one-line fields that connect business outcomes to requirement prioritization. It is deleted for internal tools, experiments, or meta workspaces, and reviewed at each milestone by `/gsd-complete-milestone` when present.

### `ROADMAP.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Milestone and phase listing with goals, requirement IDs, success criteria, and canonical references per phase. The single source of truth for what the project is building and in what order. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-new-project` (initial creation); updated by `/gsd-phase --insert` and `/gsd-complete-milestone`. |
| **Consumed by** | `/gsd-discuss-phase`, `/gsd-plan-phase`, `/gsd-execute-phase`; all orchestration commands that need phase information; `gsd-planner`, `gsd-plan-checker`, `gsd-phase-researcher`. |

### `REQUIREMENTS.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Numbered, checkable acceptance criteria for the project. Each requirement carries an ID (e.g., `AUTH-01`) that maps to roadmap phases. Marks requirements complete as phases are executed. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-new-project` (initial creation); requirements marked complete by `execute-phase`. |
| **Consumed by** | `gsd-planner` (plans must address all phase requirement IDs); `gsd-plan-checker` Dimension 1 (requirement coverage); `discuss-phase` (prior requirements). |

### `STATE.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Living position tracker — current phase and plan, progress metrics, accumulated decisions, session continuity notes. Read at the start of every workflow run. Updated after every significant action. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-new-project` (initial creation); updated continuously by all phase workflows, `/gsd-pause-work`, `/gsd-resume-work`. |
| **Consumed by** | All orchestration workflows; `/gsd-progress`; ad-hoc task execution via `/gsd-quick`; `gsd-planner` and `gsd-phase-researcher` (project decisions). |

See [STATE.md schema](state-md.md) for the full field reference.

### `config.json`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Workflow configuration: model profiles, research and plan-checker toggles, git branching strategy, Nyquist validation, parallelisation settings, and per-agent model overrides. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-new-project` (initial creation); `/gsd-settings` (interactive editing). |
| **Consumed by** | Every workflow and subagent — read at init time via `gsd-tools query config-get`. |

See [CONFIGURATION](../CONFIGURATION.md) for the complete schema.

### `MILESTONES.md` (optional)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Historical record of completed milestones. Populated as each milestone is closed; provides an archival snapshot of what shipped and when. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-complete-milestone`. |
| **Consumed by** | `/gsd-audit-milestone`; human review. |

### `DECISIONS-INDEX.md` (optional)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Bounded rolling summary of decisions captured in prior-phase CONTEXT.md files. When present, `discuss-phase` reads this single file instead of reading up to three prior CONTEXT.md files individually, saving context budget. |
| **Produced by** | Generated when the number of prior phases exceeds the rolling-read threshold. |
| **Consumed by** | `discuss-phase` (`load_prior_context` step). |

### `HANDOFF.json` (transient)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Machine-readable pause state written when work is interrupted. Contains the resume point, in-progress context, and continuation instructions. Consumed exactly once — on resume. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-pause-work`. |
| **Consumed by** | `/gsd-resume-work`. |

---

## Per-phase artifacts

All per-phase files live under `.planning/phases/<NN>-<slug>/` where `NN` is the zero-padded phase number and `slug` is the hyphenated phase name.

### `<NN>-CONTEXT.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Implementation decisions captured before planning begins. Contains the phase boundary (`<domain>`), locked decisions with `D-NN` identifiers (`<decisions>`), canonical document references (`<canonical_refs>`), existing code insights (`<code_context>`), specific inspirations (`<specifics>`), and deferred ideas (`<deferred>`). |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-discuss-phase` (interactive discussion or PRD/ADR express paths). |
| **Consumed by** | `gsd-phase-researcher` (what to investigate); `gsd-planner` (locked decisions); `gsd-plan-checker` Dimension 7 (context compliance). |

See [CONTEXT.md schema](context-md.md) for the full field reference.

### `<NN>-DISCUSSION-LOG.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Human-readable audit trail of the discuss-phase session: areas discussed, options presented, selections made, deferred ideas, and items left to Claude's discretion. Not consumed by automated workflows. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-discuss-phase` (`git_commit` step). |
| **Consumed by** | Human review; retrospectives. |

### `<NN>-RESEARCH.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Technical research findings produced before planning. Answers "What do I need to know to plan this phase well?" — covers domain analysis, patterns, risks, an Architectural Responsibility Map, and a Validation Architecture section (used by the Nyquist gate). |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-plan-phase` via `gsd-phase-researcher` agent. |
| **Consumed by** | `gsd-planner` (planning inputs); `gsd-plan-checker` Dimension 7c (tier compliance), Dimension 8 (Nyquist), Dimension 11 (research resolution); `gsd-pattern-mapper` (file list source). |

### `<NN>-VALIDATION.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Nyquist-inspired validation strategy derived from the `## Validation Architecture` section of RESEARCH.md. Specifies automated test coverage requirements that plans must honour. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-plan-phase` (Step 5.5, when `workflow.nyquist_validation` is enabled and RESEARCH.md contains a Validation Architecture section). |
| **Consumed by** | `gsd-plan-checker` Dimension 8 (Check 8e gate — must exist before Nyquist checks proceed); `gsd-verifier`. |

### `<NN>-PATTERNS.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Codebase analog map produced by `gsd-pattern-mapper`. For each file to be created or modified this phase, identifies the closest existing analog, classifies the file's role and data flow, and extracts concrete code excerpts. Guides the planner towards consistent patterns. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-plan-phase` via `gsd-pattern-mapper` agent (optional; skipped if `workflow.pattern_mapper: false`). |
| **Consumed by** | `gsd-planner` (pattern guidance); `gsd-plan-checker` Dimension 12 (pattern compliance). |

### `<NN>-<PP>-PLAN.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Executable plan for a single unit of work within the phase. Contains YAML frontmatter (wave, dependencies, files, requirements, `must_haves`), an objective, context references, XML-structured tasks with `<read_first>`, `<action>`, `<verify>`, and `<acceptance_criteria>` fields, and verification criteria. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-plan-phase` via `gsd-planner` agent. One file per plan — e.g., `03-02-PLAN.md` is Phase 3, Plan 2. |
| **Consumed by** | `/gsd-execute-phase` (executor agent reads plan and runs tasks); `gsd-plan-checker` (pre-execution quality review); `gsd-verifier` (reads `must_haves` for post-execution verification). |

See [PLAN.md schema](plan-md.md) for the full field reference.

### `<NN>-<PP>-SUMMARY.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Execution record written after a plan completes. Documents what was built, deviations from the plan, a self-check against acceptance criteria, and the dependency graph for the phase. |
| **Produced by** | `execute-phase` executor agent (written at the end of each plan's execution). |
| **Consumed by** | `/gsd-progress` (phase status); `gsd-planner` (when a subsequent plan has a genuine dependency on prior plan output); `milestone-summary`. |

### `<NN>-VERIFICATION.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Phase goal verification report. Checks `must_haves.truths`, `must_haves.artifacts`, and `must_haves.key_links` from all plans against the actual codebase after execution. Records `status: passed \| gaps_found \| human_needed`. A truth whose correctness depends on runtime behaviour — a state transition or a cancellation/cleanup/ordering invariant — is marked `⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED` (not `VERIFIED`) when no test exercises it: it is excluded from `score`, counted in the `behavior_unverified` frontmatter field, and routed to `human_needed`, so a behaviour-dependent gap can no longer count toward a clean N/N. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-verify-work` (or the verify step within `/gsd-execute-phase`). |
| **Consumed by** | `plan-phase` closed-phase gate (a `status: passed` VERIFICATION.md marks the phase `Complete` and blocks replanning without `--force`); `/gsd-progress`; human review. |

### `<NN>-UAT.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Persistent UAT session tracking. Records each test case, expected observable behaviour, result, and developer response across a live UAT session. Carries YAML frontmatter (`status`, `phase`, `source`, timestamps). |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-audit-uat` (interactive UAT session). |
| **Consumed by** | `/gsd-audit-uat` (resume a previous UAT session). |

### `.continue-here.md`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Human-readable resume instructions written when work on a phase is paused. Contains context for resuming agents: critical anti-patterns, blocking issues, required reading, and the exact command to resume. |
| **Produced by** | `/gsd-pause-work`. |
| **Consumed by** | Any workflow that starts on a phase — `discuss-phase` and `plan-phase` both check for this file at entry and require the agent to demonstrate understanding of any `blocking` anti-patterns before proceeding. |

### `.planning/async-jobs/<job>.json`

**Purpose**: Durable manifest for an async external job dispatched during Execute (long-running compute, e.g. HPC solver/training jobs). Its presence makes an Execute step's SUMMARY-absent state a *legal* `external_job_waiting` deferral rather than an illegal partial-plan state.

**Stability contract (Hyrum's Law).** This schema is a depended-upon interface across the core loop and every scheduler backend. The core loop consumes only the named fields below and ignores any others; producers MUST write these fields and MAY add their own. The `version` field is the escape hatch for evolving the schema without breaking consumers. Coordinate any change with both the core half (#1165) and the producer capability (#1164).

**Produced by**: a scheduler-adapter Capability at the `execute:wave:post` loop extension point (the capability half — tracked in #1164, default-off). Core never writes this file.

**Consumed by**: `execute-phase` safe-resume, `resume-project`, and `pause-work` (the core half — #1165).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | string | Manifest schema version (`"1.0"`). |
| `job_id` | string | Backend-assigned job identifier. |
| `plan_id` | string | `<phase>-<plan>` this job belongs to — the key tying the job to its Execute step. |
| `phase` | string | Phase number. |
| `backend` | string | Scheduler/backend name (e.g. `slurm`). **Opaque to core** — core never interprets or invokes it. |
| `submit_command` | string | Exact command used to submit the job (audit / resubmit). |
| `status` | enum | Scheduler-agnostic lifecycle state (see below). |
| `expected_artifacts` | string[] | Paths the job is expected to produce; verified before the plan is closed. |
| `verification_command` | string | Command that verifies the job's output before close-out. |
| `resume_command` | string | Exact command to resume GSD reconciliation (re-enter the loop to re-check the job), e.g. `/gsd:execute-phase <phase>`. This is a GSD reconciliation entry point, not a scheduler resubmit. |
| `submitted_at` | string | ISO 8601 submission timestamp. |
| `terminal_details` | object \| null | Failure/terminal-state detail; `null` while non-terminal. |

**`status` enum** — closed and scheduler-agnostic; producers map backend states onto these, and core reads only these:

- `submitted`, `running` — **non-terminal**. The plan is in the legal `external_job_waiting` half-state; resume re-checks and never re-dispatches the plan.
- `completed-unverified` — job finished but output not yet verified; resume MUST verify `expected_artifacts` / run `verification_command` before writing SUMMARY.md and closing the plan.
- `failed`, `cancelled`, `timeout` — **terminal failure**; resume surfaces `terminal_details` and offers recovery: re-run reconciliation (`resume_command`), abort, or mark-and-skip. Resubmitting compute is a Capability/user action, never an automatic core action.

**Trust boundary — manifest commands are untrusted input.** The manifest crosses a trust seam: a Capability (or anything that can write `.planning/`) produces it; the core loop consumes it. `submit_command`, `verification_command`, and `resume_command` are therefore UNTRUSTED. The core loop MUST NOT auto-execute them — before running any manifest-sourced command, surface the exact command and its manifest path to the user and require explicit confirmation. Validate before trusting a manifest: `version` is a recognized schema version, `plan_id` matches the plan under reconciliation, and `status` is one of the closed enum values. If a manifest is malformed or unrecognized, surface the anomaly and stop rather than acting on it.

**Matching, multiple, and malformed manifests.** Match a manifest to a plan by its exact `plan_id` (string-equal — phase ids may contain `.`). If more than one manifest matches a single `plan_id`, or a matched manifest is not valid JSON, fail closed: surface the conflict and stop; never pick one heuristically.

**No auto-dispatch (duplicate-execution guard).** A plan whose `plan_id` matches a manifest (any status) is excluded from EVERY dispatch path — `execute-phase` `safe_resume_gate`, `execute-phase` `discover_and_group_plans` (normal and cross-AI), and `execute-plan` plan-selection. Never spawn a fresh executor for such a plan; reconcile instead. Re-dispatching would duplicate the external job.

**Matching a manifest to a plan** (glob-safe — tolerates an absent directory):
```bash
ASYNC_MANIFEST=$(find .planning/async-jobs -maxdepth 1 -name '*.json' -exec grep -lE "\"plan_id\"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*\"${CURRENT_PLAN_ID}\"" {} + 2>/dev/null || true)
```
Match by exact `plan_id`. If more than one manifest matches, or any matched manifest is not valid JSON, fail closed: surface the conflict and stop.

**Reconciliation by status** (manifest commands are untrusted — surface + require explicit user confirmation before running any):
- `submitted` / `running` → non-terminal; still waiting. Report the job and stop; resume later. Never re-dispatch.
- `completed-unverified` → after confirmation, verify `expected_artifacts` / run `verification_command`; only on success write SUMMARY.md and close the plan. If artifacts are missing, surface the anomaly — do not close.
- `failed` / `cancelled` / `timeout` → terminal failure; surface `terminal_details` and offer recovery (re-run reconciliation via `resume_command`, abort, or mark-and-skip). Resubmitting compute is a Capability/user action, never automatic.

## Naming conventions

| Segment | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Phase directory | `<NN>-<slug>` | `03-post-feed` |
| Phase-level file | `<NN>-<ARTIFACT>.md` | `03-CONTEXT.md` |
| Plan-level file | `<NN>-<PP>-<ARTIFACT>.md` | `03-02-PLAN.md` |
| `NN` | Zero-padded phase number | `03` for Phase 3 |
| `PP` | Zero-padded plan number within phase | `02` for Plan 2 |

When `project_code` is set in `config.json`, phase directories use the project code as a prefix: `CK-03-post-feed` for project code `CK`, Phase 3.
