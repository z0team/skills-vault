- Enforces a comment-text discipline HARD GATE at plan-write time (`verify.plan-structure`): a literal that an acceptance criterion negative-greps for (`grep -c 'LIT' file == 0`) must not appear verbatim in an `<action>` body; violations fail plan creation. Use `<!-- planner-discipline-allow: LIT -->` to allowlist a legitimate occurrence. (#429)

---

| **Disallowed Tools** | Edit, MultiEdit |
| **Model (balanced)** | Sonnet |
| **Color** | Green |
| **Produces** | `{phase}-VERIFICATION.md` |

**Key behaviors:**
- Checks codebase against phase goals, not just task completion
- PASS/FAIL with specific evidence
- Logs issues for `/gsd-verify-work` to address
- Milestone scope filtering: gaps addressed in later phases are marked as "deferred", not reported as failures (v1.32)
- **Test quality audit** (v1.32): verifies that tests prove what they claim by checking for disabled/skipped tests on requirements, circular test patterns (system generating its own expected values), assertion strength (existence vs. value vs. behavioral), and expected value provenance. Blockers from test quality audit override an otherwise passing verification
- Runs the full workspace test suite at most once per verification — proves a test *exists* by enumeration and that it *passes* via a single named test, never re-running the whole suite per must-have.
- **Behavior-dependent calibration (#966):** a must-have that asserts a state transition or a cancellation/cleanup/ordering invariant is marked `⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED` (not `VERIFIED`) when no test exercises it — excluded from the `verified_truths` score, counted in the `behavior_unverified` frontmatter field, and routed to human verification, so a clean `N/N` certifies behavioral evidence rather than mere symbol presence.

---

**Key behaviors:**
- Read-only exploration + structured output
- Writes documents directly to disk
- No reasoning required — pattern extraction from file contents

**`--paths <p1,p2,...>` scope hint (#2003):**
Accepts an optional `--paths` directive in its prompt. When present, the
mapper restricts Glob/Grep/Bash exploration to the listed repo-relative path
prefixes — this is the incremental-remap path used by the post-execute
codebase-drift gate. Path values that contain `..`, start with `/`, or
include shell metacharacters are rejected. Without the hint, the mapper
runs its default whole-repo scan.

---

### gsd-debugger

- Strictly read-only against source; only writes `PATTERNS.md`

---

### gsd-debug-session-manager

**Role:** Runs the full `/gsd-debug` checkpoint-and-continuation loop in an isolated context so the orchestrator's main context stays lean; spawns `gsd-debugger` agents, dispatches specialist skills, and handles user checkpoints via AskUserQuestion.

| **Model (balanced)** | Sonnet |
| **Color** | Orange |
| **Produces** | `REVIEW.md` in the phase directory |

**Key behaviors:**

- Honors `CLAUDE.md` project conventions and `.claude/skills/` / `.agents/skills/` rules when present
- Read-only against implementation source — never modifies code under review

---

### gsd-code-fixer

- Produces rubric ingredients that downstream evaluators can turn into measurable criteria

---

### gsd-eval-planner

**Role:** Designs the structured evaluation strategy for an AI phase — failure modes, eval dimensions with rubrics, tooling, reference dataset, guardrails, production monitoring. Writes Sections 5–7 of `AI-SPEC.md`.

**Required reading:** `gsd-core/references/ai-evals.md` (evaluation framework).

**Key behaviors:**
- Turns domain-researcher rubric ingredients into measurable, tooled evaluation criteria
- Does not re-derive domain context — reads Section 1 and 1b of `AI-SPEC.md` as established input

---

### gsd-eval-auditor

**Role:** Retroactive audit of an implemented AI phase's evaluation coverage against its planned `AI-SPEC.md` eval strategy. Scores each eval dimension `COVERED` / `PARTIAL` / `MISSING` and produces `EVAL-REVIEW.md`.

| **Parallelism** | Single instance (interactive) |
| **Tools** | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion |
| **Model (balanced)** | Sonnet |
| **Color** | Cyan |
| **Produces** | Scored ranked recommendation (structured return to orchestrator) |

**Required reading:** `gsd-core/references/ai-frameworks.md` (decision matrix).

**Key behaviors:**
- Scans `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt` for existing AI libraries before the interview to avoid recommending a rejected framework
- Asks only what the codebase scan and CONTEXT.md have not already answered

---

### gsd-intel-updater

**Role:** Reads project source and writes structured intel (JSON + Markdown) into `.planning/intel/`, building a queryable codebase knowledge base that other agents use instead of performing expensive fresh exploration.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Spawned by** | `/gsd-map-codebase --query` (refresh / update flows) |
| **Parallelism** | Single instance |
| **Tools** | Read, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep |
| **Model (balanced)** | Sonnet |
| **Color** | Cyan |
| **Produces** | `.planning/intel/*.json` (and companion Markdown) consumed by `gsd-tools query intel` |

**Key behaviors:**
- Writes current state only — no temporal language, every claim references an actual file path
- Uses Glob / Read / Grep for cross-platform correctness; Bash is reserved for `gsd-tools query intel` CLI calls

---

### gsd-doc-classifier

**Role:** Classifies a single planning document as ADR, PRD, SPEC, DOC, or UNKNOWN. Extracts title, scope summary, and cross-references. Writes a JSON classification file used by `gsd-doc-synthesizer` to build a consolidated context.

| **Tools** | Read, Write, Grep, Glob |
| **Model (balanced)** | Haiku |
| **Color** | Yellow |
| **Produces** | One JSON classification file per input doc (type, title, scope, refs) |

**Key behaviors:**
- Single-doc scope — never synthesizes or resolves conflicts (that is the synthesizer's job)
- Heuristic-first classification; returns UNKNOWN when the doc lacks type signals rather than guessing

---

### gsd-doc-synthesizer

**Role:** Synthesizes classified planning docs into a single consolidated context. Applies precedence rules, detects cross-reference cycles, enforces LOCKED-vs-LOCKED hard-blocks, and writes `INGEST-CONFLICTS.md` with three buckets (auto-resolved, competing-variants, unresolved-blockers).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Spawned by** | `/gsd-ingest-docs` (after classifier fan-in) |
| **Parallelism** | Single instance |
| **Tools** | Read, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash |
| **Model (balanced)** | Sonnet |
| **Color** | Orange |
| **Produces** | Consolidated context for `.planning/` plus `INGEST-CONFLICTS.md` report |

**Key behaviors:**
- Hard-blocks on LOCKED-vs-LOCKED ADR contradictions instead of silently picking a winner
- Follows the `references/doc-conflict-engine.md` contract so `/gsd-import` and `/gsd-ingest-docs` produce consistent conflict reports

### gsd-mempalace-curator

**Role:** Ship-time memory curation — writes per-agent diary entries, proposes and creates cross-project tunnels, runs wing-scoped sync pruning, and mirrors `extract-learnings` output into MemPalace's temporal knowledge graph with provenance.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Spawned by** | MemPalace capability at `ship:post` (when `mempalace.enabled = true`); diary/tunnels/KG-mirror are then refined by their own toggles |
| **Parallelism** | Single instance |
| **Tools** | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob |
| **Model (balanced)** | Sonnet |
| **Produces** | Diary entry in MemPalace, wing tunnel proposals, KG provenance records |

**Key behaviors:**
- Best-effort only — every operation is `onError: skip`; a MemPalace failure never halts the loop
- Wing-scoped sync pruning (`mempalace sync --wing <wing> --apply`) — never runs a global prune
- Cross-project tunnel proposals when `mempalace.cross_project_tunnels = true`
- Mirrors `extract-learnings` decisions, lessons, patterns, and surprises into the KG with `source_drawer_id` provenance
- Requires MemPalace MCP server or CLI to be reachable; writes a skip-notice stub when unavailable

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Checkers are read-only (no Write/Edit) — they evaluate, never modify
- Researchers have web access — they need current ecosystem information
- Executors have Edit — they modify code but not web access
- Mappers have Write — they write analysis documents but not Edit (no code changes)
