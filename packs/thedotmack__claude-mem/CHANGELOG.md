## [13.7.0] - 2026-06-20

## PostHog telemetry overhaul

A ground-up rebuild of claude-mem's telemetry — per-session rollups, unified instrumentation, and real (redacted) error tracking. Grounded in live PostHog data: the raw-event volume was confirmed to be **legacy-fleet decay** (raw `session_compressed` fell ~75% in two days as installs updated), so this is the proper rebuild, not a hotfix.

### What's new
- **Per-session rollups** — `observer_turn_rollup` is now emitted **once per session at session end** (`rollup_reason` = session_end | worker_shutdown | safety_flush, plus `window_seq`) instead of per 5-minute wall-clock window. Memory-bounded with a safety sweep; drains correctly on worker shutdown.
- **Unified instrumentation** — a single `instrument()` path fans out to the local logger (full fidelity) and telemetry (scrubbed/rolled-up). The logger stays telemetry-free.
- **Redacted error tracking** — real error messages + trimmed stacks now reach PostHog as `$exception` events, consent-gated, profile-less, and fingerprint rate-limited. An allow-then-redact scrubber strips home dirs, absolute paths, DB connection-string credentials, URL userinfo, emails, API tokens (sk-/phc-/ghp-/AWS AKIA/JWT), hex, and IPv4; messages cap at 500 chars, stacks at ~2KB. Autocapture is fully redacted (on-disk source context is stripped, never sent).
- **New kill-switch** — `CLAUDE_MEM_TELEMETRY_ERRORS=0` disables error capture independently of analytics.
- **Docs** — `telemetry.mdx` rewritten to document the new model, the error-tracking opt-in + one-way-door note, and the opt-out switches.

### Privacy
This release begins collecting redacted error messages/stacks (a deliberate, consent-gated shift from whitelist-only telemetry). Raw paths, prompts, project names, source code, and model output are still never collected. Opt out of all telemetry with `CLAUDE_MEM_TELEMETRY=0` / `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, or errors-only with `CLAUDE_MEM_TELEMETRY_ERRORS=0`.

## [13.6.2] - 2026-06-17

## What's Changed

### Telemetry cost reduction (#2977)
- **TelemetryBuffer rollup windows** — high-volume `session_compressed` and `context_injected` events are now aggregated into 5-minute rollup windows (`observer_turn_rollup`, `context_injected_rollup`) before forwarding to PostHog, replacing ~45M individual events/month with ~20K rollup records. Cuts the projected PostHog bill from ~$7,700/mo to ~$10/mo without losing aggregate shape (counts, sums, averages, top model, per-outcome buckets).
- **Outcome visibility in `context_injected_rollup`** — added `outcomes_ok` / `outcomes_error` buckets so a window of 100% failed injections is distinguishable from one of zero-token successes.

### CI
- **Windows build pinned to `windows-2022`** — the `windows-latest` image moved to `windows-2025` (Visual Studio 18), which the bundled `node-gyp@11.5.0` can't detect, breaking native `tree-sitter` rebuilds. Pinned to `windows-2022` (VS2022) until node-gyp gains VS18 support.

## [13.6.1] - 2026-06-15

Patch release.

- feat(telemetry): backfill historical token-savings economics (#2934) — backfills inferred generation-cost economics into anonymized daily telemetry rollups, with scrub coverage and tests.

Full changelog: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

## [13.6.0] - 2026-06-13

## 📊 Historical Telemetry Backfill

claude-mem's growth metrics now extend back before telemetry existed. On the first worker start after this upgrade, each install performs a **one-time backfill** of anonymized daily activity rollups into PostHog via historical-migration ingestion — so installs-over-time, reconstructed WAU/MAU, and cohort retention reflect real usage history instead of starting at the telemetry ship date.

### What gets sent
**Anonymous counts only — never titles, prompts, file contents, or project names:**
- One profile-less `historical_activity` event per active day: observation/session/summary/prompt counts, observation-type breakdown, session outcomes, platform buckets, subagent counts, and compression discovery-token totals — all tagged `backfilled: true`
- One `install_inferred` event carrying the install's first active date, drawn from trustworthy session timestamps

### Privacy & safety
- Honors the exact same consent gates as live telemetry: `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `CLAUDE_MEM_TELEMETRY=0`, and `telemetry.json` opt-out. Opting out before your first post-upgrade worker start prevents the backfill entirely; a later opt-in still backfills.
- Runs **once per install**, latched by a completion marker written only after confirmed delivery — failed sends retry on the next worker start, and deterministic event uuids make retries duplicate-safe.
- `CLAUDE_MEM_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1` dry-runs the full payload to stderr without sending anything.
- Legacy epoch normalization and corrupt-row guards keep bad timestamps out of the historical record; partial days are never shipped.

Full disclosure documented at [docs.claude-mem.ai/telemetry](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/telemetry).

**PR**: #2912

## [13.5.7] - 2026-06-13

## What's Fixed

### Stale Claude CLI can no longer silently kill every observation (#2911)

If an abandoned npm-global `claude` binary sat earlier in PATH than your current install, every Observer spawn died instantly at flag parsing — worker healthy, zero observations, nothing in the logs. The resolver now:

- **Probes every candidate for capability**, not just existence: each CLI is tested with `--permission-mode dontAsk --version`, the exact flags claude-mem passes on every agent spawn. Binaries that reject them (older than the 2.1.x line) are skipped up front with a clear warning.
- **Prefers the newest capable version** — PATH order only breaks ties, so a stale binary can't shadow a current one.
- **Fails loud, never silent**: an explicit `CLAUDE_CODE_PATH` that's too old throws with the version and the remedy; if every CLI found is too old, the error names each path and version.
- **Self-heals on CLI updates**: successful resolutions are cached 15 minutes, failures are never cached — updating your CLI is picked up on the next observation without a worker restart.
- **Keeps a 2KB stderr tail** from SDK children, included in exit warnings (and read on `close`, so it's never truncated) — a CLI dying at flag parsing now says why at default log level.

### Build

- Bundle-size budgets are now advisory warnings instead of hard build failures.

## [13.5.6] - 2026-06-11

## Worker restart: single source of truth (#2894)

This release rearchitects worker lifecycle management to eliminate the restart races behind version-recycle ping-pong storms, EADDRINUSE failures, and "healthy worker reports as not running" lies.

### Highlights

- **Self-replacing worker** — on restart, the dying worker spawns its own successor the moment its port frees. Old and new workers never coexist, and nothing external races to spawn into the gap. Hooks wait for the successor and lazy-spawn only as a fallback, at most one recycle per hook event.
- **Restarts prove themselves** — `worker-service restart` now polls `/api/health` until the pid changes AND the version matches the new build, prints `Worker restart verified (pid, version)`, and exits 1 on failure instead of reporting success over a dead or stale worker. The daemon's generic start-failure path also exits 1 now.
- **One spawn gate** — a `wx`-flag lockfile (`spawn.lock`, 60s mtime staleness, owner-checked release) serializes every external spawn path: hook lazy-spawn, MCP server, and the CLI restart fallback. Lock losers wait for the winner's worker instead of colliding. The two divergent Bun resolvers are unified (closing the kill-then-can't-respawn path), and the MCP server now prefers the marketplace worker script over stale plugin-cache copies.
- **PID file demoted to diagnostics** — liveness truth is the port + `/api/health`. Every PID-file deletion is owner-guarded, so a dying worker can never clobber its successor's file; `status` reports pid/version/uptime/workerPath from health alone and survives PID-file deletion.
- **First-run fix** — settings bootstrap notices now go to stderr, never stdout: the very first hook invocation on a fresh install no longer emits corrupted JSON to the hook framework.
- **Build chain hardened** — the dev sync-script's installed-version cache mirror (which wrote new code into old version dirs, manufacturing permanent version disagreement) and its duplicate HTTP restart trigger are deleted; `build-and-sync` restarts through one verified CLI path.
- **Test hygiene** — the test suite can no longer touch the real `~/.claude-mem` (a preload tripwire isolates every run), ending sentinel-PID and corrupt-JSON pollution of production state.

### Validation

Triple-restart soak (3× consecutive verified restarts, zero duplicate/EADDRINUSE events), plus a live re-creation of the original stale-launcher bug under concurrent session crossfire: one recycle per stale instance, convergence in 16 seconds, zero ping-pong over an 8.5-minute watch. 2,247 tests pass.

## [13.5.5] - 2026-06-10

## Telemetry Reliability Signals (Plan 14)

claude-mem instrumented success well — failure was invisible. This release adds the five highest-value missing reliability signals (#2874). Everything is closed-enum/count-only, whitelisted in the scrubber, and disclosed in both the [public docs](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/telemetry) and `claude-mem telemetry`.

### Search retrieval quality (`search_performed`)
- `result_count`, `search_strategy` (`chroma|fts|filter_only`), `chroma_available`, `fallback_reason` (`none|chroma_connection|chroma_error|chroma_not_initialized`)
- Zero-result rate is now computable, and Chroma's silent degradation to FTS is visible.

### Compression trust (`session_compressed`)
- `fabrication_detected` / `fabricated_count` — commit-hash fabrication by the observer model, on every emit path
- Respawn-gated invalid-output events: `invalid_output_class` (`xml|idle|prose|poisoned`), `consecutive_invalid_outputs`, `respawn_triggered`
- `outcome: aborted` with `abort_reason` (`idle|shutdown|overflow|restart_guard|quota|poisoned|none`), emitted where all abort flows converge

### Worker lifecycle
- New `worker_stopped` event: `uptime_seconds`, `shutdown_reason` (`stop|restart|signal`)
- Crash detection via clean-shutdown sentinel: `worker_started` now reports `previous_shutdown` (`crash|clean|unknown`) and `previous_uptime_seconds`
- Memory health: integer `process_rss_mb` / `heap_used_mb` on lifecycle events and the heartbeat

### Hook failures
- New `hook_failed` event over the direct CLI transport (the worker being unreachable IS the failure being reported), threshold-gated on the fail-loud counter and awaited before process exit so events survive short-lived hook processes

### Fixes
- **CI**: the PostHog `disableGeoip` regression test was order-dependent and failed full-suite runs (CI on main had been red since v13.5.4). `posthog-node` is now mocked globally via a bun test preload — which also guarantees test runs can never construct a real PostHog client and flush fabricated events into production analytics.
- Windows-managed shutdown IPC now forwards the restart reason for `shutdown_reason` fidelity.

## [13.5.4] - 2026-06-10

## Fixed

- **Telemetry geolocation: closed the ~98.5% "unknown location" gap.** The posthog-node SDK assumes server deployments and stamps `$geoip_disable: true` on every event by default. claude-mem's worker runs on the user's own machine, so this needlessly suppressed PostHog's ingest-side GeoIP on all worker events (`worker_started`, `session_compressed`, `context_injected`, …). The client now passes `disableGeoip: false`, letting PostHog derive coarse location (country / region / city) at ingestion — from the request IP, which is then discarded. CLI events (`install_*`) were already unaffected.

## Privacy

- No change to the IP promise: raw IP addresses are still **never attached to events by the client and never stored** — the sender IP is used transiently at ingest for the coarse-location lookup, then discarded.
- The telemetry docs (https://docs.claude-mem.ai/telemetry) and the `npx claude-mem telemetry enable` consent screen now disclose the ingest-derived coarse location.

## Tests

- New regression test asserts the PostHog client is constructed with `disableGeoip: false` (telemetry suite now 58 tests, all passing).

## [13.5.3] - 2026-06-10

## Telemetry: real data edition

Every analytics number claude-mem reports about itself is now real, provider-reported data — plus a new daily install-state snapshot so we can see the actual state of the installed base.

### Fixed: the four session_compressed data-quality bugs

- **Claude token counts were placeholders.** The Agent SDK attaches an early-streaming usage snapshot to assistant messages (`output_tokens` of ~2–10, regardless of actual output). The `session_compressed` event is now fired from the SDK **result** message, which carries the finalized per-turn usage — verified empirically (placeholder said 8, result said 45). Compression ratios for Claude models drop from a nonsensical 6,000–38,000 to the true ~10–100 range.
- **`cost_usd` is now real and populated.** Claude: computed from the SDK's cumulative `total_cost_usd` delta between consecutive turns. OpenRouter: `usage.cost` + `cost_details.upstream_inference_cost` (covers BYOK), with usage accounting requested from openrouter.ai only. Gemini reports no cost, so the field stays honestly absent — never estimated.
- **Impossible compression ratios (< 1, or exactly 0.0) eliminated.** Custom OpenAI-compatible gateways that report suffix-only or one-sided token usage can no longer produce half-real events: usage is now both-sides-or-nothing, ratios require input > 0, and a new `endpoint_class` property (`openrouter` | `custom`) lets dashboards segment gateway-reported data.
- **`model` is never silently missing or wrong.** The model that actually served the request (`response.model`) is stamped instead of the raw configured string, array-typed model settings are normalized, error-path events now carry the model, and `unknown` is the floor everywhere — non-string values previously vanished in the telemetry scrubber.

### New: install-state snapshot

`worker_started` (start + daily heartbeat) now reports an aggregate snapshot of the local memory DB as person properties: observation/session/summary/project counts, DB file size, install age in days, observations in the last 7/30 days, and days since the last observation. Counts and day-deltas only — never project names, text, or any content. Makes retention, scale, and activity cohorts directly sliceable in analytics.

### Also fixed

- The `ide` person property on `worker_started` never populated — the lookup queried a legacy table and silently threw on every start since it shipped.
- Epoch math now normalizes legacy seconds-unit rows (a few hundred per install) that would have reported install ages of ~20,000 days.

All new properties are whitelisted in the scrubber, documented at https://docs.claude-mem.ai/telemetry, and shown in the `npx claude-mem telemetry` consent screen. Telemetry remains anonymous and opt-out (`npx claude-mem telemetry disable`).

## [13.5.2] - 2026-06-10

## What's New in 13.5.2

Platform and toolchain telemetry to diagnose the install → live-worker activation dropoff (anonymous, opt-out — see `npx claude-mem telemetry`):

- Every event now carries `os_version` (kernel release — distinguishes Windows 10 vs 11, macOS releases), `is_wsl`, and `node_version` alongside the existing `os`/`arch`/`runtime` fields.
- `install_completed` now reports `interactive` (TTY vs scripted), `install_method` (npm / bun / pnpm / yarn), and detected `bun_version`, `uv_version`, and `claude_code_version`.
- `install_failed` carries the same install context so aborted installs are sliceable by platform too.
- New fields are person properties as well, so activation funnels can be broken down by OS version, WSL, and install method.
- Scrub whitelist, consent screen, docs, and tests updated for every new property.

## [13.5.1] - 2026-06-10

## What's New in 13.5.1

Deep telemetry instrumentation (anonymous, opt-out — see `npx claude-mem telemetry`):

- **`context_injected`** now reports token economics and observation-type breakdowns via the new `generateContextWithStats()` context builder, so we can measure real context savings.
- **`session_compressed`** enriched with provider, model, real per-call token counts (Claude, Gemini, and OpenRouter at parity), latency, and observation-type breakdown.
- **Lifecycle events** now create person profiles with IDE, provider, and mode properties, unlocking retention/cohort analytics (DAU/WAU via daily worker heartbeat).
- `worker_started` capture moved after DB init so it reflects a genuinely live worker.
- Telemetry scrub whitelist expanded and tested for all new properties; consent screen and docs list every property collected.

## [13.5.0] - 2026-06-10

## Anonymous usage analytics (PostHog) — and the v13.5.0 release

claude-mem now ships anonymous, privacy-hardened usage analytics. This is the first release with any telemetry, and it follows the standard dev-tool model (Homebrew, Next.js, Astro): **on by default, one command to opt out, and incapable of carrying your content by construction.**

### What's collected

Eight events (`install_completed`, `install_failed`, `uninstall_completed`, `worker_started`, `session_compressed`, `context_injected`, `search_performed`, `error_occurred`), identified by a random install UUID generated locally. Every property passes a strict whitelist scrubber — only numbers, booleans, and values from closed sets we define (platform, version, IDE choice, durations, counts) can leave your machine.

**Never collected — enforced by whitelist, not blocklist:** prompts or conversation content, file paths, source code, project or repo names, search queries, error messages, IP addresses, hardware identifiers, env values, emails, or any PII.

### Opting out

Any one of these turns it off:

- `npx claude-mem telemetry disable`
- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (the universal standard — overrides everything)
- `CLAUDE_MEM_TELEMETRY=0`

`npx claude-mem telemetry status` shows the current state and which setting decided it. The installer asks once at the end of `npx claude-mem install`, and your answer is never re-asked.

Full documentation of every field and event: https://docs.claude-mem.ai/telemetry

### Also in this release

- Install flow: live progress for dependency steps and a consent prompt at the end of install
- `npx claude-mem telemetry [status|enable|disable]` CLI command
- Worker shutdown now flushes telemetry with a hard 3s bound — never delays stop

## [13.4.2] - 2026-06-09

## What's new

**Installer: \"work email\" opt-in** — the CMEM Online signup prompt in `npx claude-mem install` now asks for your *work* email (placeholder `you@company.com`). This surfaces which orgs are adopting claude-mem.

## [13.4.1] - 2026-06-08

## What's new

### 🟣 CMEM Online email opt-in during `npx claude-mem install`
An optional, interactive email opt-in now appears at the start of the installer. Press Enter to skip — it never blocks or fails the install.

- Collects an email + an optional "what are you working on / how can we help your team" note.
- POSTs to the live `https://cmem.ai/api/waitlist` endpoint (handles persistence, dedup, and the confirmation email server-side). Overridable via `CLAUDE_MEM_SIGNUP_URL`; tagged `source: npx-installer`.
- Skipped automatically when non-interactive, under CI, or with `CLAUDE_MEM_ONLINE_OPTIN=false`.
- Signup is persisted locally so returning users aren't re-prompted; a failed send is retried silently on the next install.
- No secrets ship in the npx package — the endpoint is unauthenticated and the Resend key stays server-side. The waitlist endpoint was extended to capture the optional note.

### 🔴 Fixes
- Remove a duplicate `ModeManager` import that was breaking the typecheck.
- Exempt the `transcript-watcher-entry` CLI process entry point from the console-logging guard.

## [13.4.0] - 2026-05-29

Clears a large defect backlog (plans 01–11 plus standalone fixes) and adds provider configurability. Test suite moved 46 → 0 failing and typecheck 24 → 0 errors over the branch.

### Features
- **Configurable OpenAI-compatible base URL** for the OpenRouter provider (`CLAUDE_MEM_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`) — point claude-mem at DeepSeek, LM Studio, or any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

### Fixes (highlights)
- **Spawn contract (plan-02):** canonical `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolution + Windows spawn fixes (codex.cmd, chroma-mcp cmd.exe quoting).
- **Worker lifecycle (plan-03):** Windows PID-reuse start-token guard.
- **Output fidelity (plan-11):** commit-hash verification before persist; null-`cwd` no longer strips every hex string from summaries.
- **SQLite self-healing:** schema repair via `sqlite3 .recover`; close DB handle on repair error paths (no leaked write lock).
- **SessionMessageBuffer:** `clear()` now also resets the dedup set, so a previously-seen toolUseId can re-enter.
- **Standalone:** project name, dot-path encoding, path-match, CLAUDE.md denylist.

### CI / tests
- New CI workflow (typecheck · build · test · bundle-size + docker pg+valkey e2e) made green; removed npm-lockfile dependency to match the repo's no-committed-lockfile convention.
- Fixed `mock.module` logger leakage across test files and guarded sqlite3 `.recover` capability so CI runs cleanly.

## [13.3.0] - 2026-05-21

## What's New

### New skills

- **design-is** (#2483) — audits a design against Dieter Rams' ten "Good design is..." principles. Produces per-principle 0–3 scores with file:line evidence and a NEW / REFINE / REDESIGN verdict, then hands off a ready-to-run `/make-plan` prompt.
- **weekly-digests** (#2399) — produces a chapter-per-ISO-week serial digest of a project's full claude-mem timeline. Sequential subagent pipeline keeps the narrative coherent across 30+ chapters.
- **oh-my-issues** (#2409) — root-cause issue clustering. Codifies the consolidation method that turned ~100 open issues into 6 plan-masters during the v13.0.1 cycle. Three modes: cluster pass, triage, bundle.

### Fixes

- **fix(mcp): drop duplicate root `.mcp.json`** (#2411) — Claude Code's `/doctor` was warning "MCP server mcp-search skipped — same command/URL as already-configured mcp-search" for every plugin user. The root copy was vestigial; the plugin's namespaced registration now wins.
- **fix: stop Codex transcript replay after hooks migration** (#2365) — disables the default `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` watch (native Codex hooks are now authoritative). Repairs `~/.codex/config.toml` to set `[features] hooks = true` and `[plugins."claude-mem@claude-mem-local"] enabled = true` directly. Fixes transcript replay where files discovered after startup ignored `startAtEnd` and re-injected history.

Opt back into legacy Codex transcript ingestion with `CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_TRANSCRIPT_INGESTION=true` if you depend on the JSONL watcher.

## [13.2.0] - 2026-05-12

## What's new

### `wowerpoint` skill — kawaii NotebookLM slide-deck generator

Turn one source document into a kawaii NotebookLM slide-deck PDF. Wraps the `notebooklm` CLI with the kawaii-prompt + `--format detailed` defaults and a spawn-subagent pattern so generation (~10 min) never blocks the main conversation.

- **Single-source-per-deck** is enforced by the workflow shape: confirm or write the source doc *before* adding it to NotebookLM. Don't paper over a weak source by stacking more sources — write a comprehensive doc first.
- **Slide-deck only.** Videos and podcasts from the same engine are noticeably worse and out of scope; the skill refers users to the `notebooklm` CLI directly for those formats.
- **Default prompt template:** `Use kawaii characters to tell the story of <subject>. Keep it warm and clear.` Pass any user-supplied prompt through verbatim.
- **Setup requires** `notebooklm-py` (via `uv tool install --with playwright`), `playwright install chromium`, and `jq`.
- **Spawn-and-end-turn** pattern: the subagent's completion notification fires when the PDF is on disk; the main conversation never blocks on the ~10 min render.

See PR #2430 for the full design notes and review history.

## Skills inventory

This release brings the plugin to **12 skills**: babysit, do, how-it-works, knowledge-agent, learn-codebase, make-plan, mem-search, pathfinder, smart-explore, timeline-report, version-bump, wowerpoint.

## [13.1.0] - 2026-05-11

## Server-beta event pipeline (phases 4–13)

This release lands the full server-beta track developed on `server-beta-phase-4-event-pipeline` — a self-contained Postgres + BullMQ event-to-observation pipeline with API-key auth, team/project scope, audit log, three AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google), a dedicated MCP server, legacy compat adapters for existing worker clients, a Docker/Compose stack, and a generation-job retry/cancel surface.

### Highlights

- **Event pipeline**: `agent_event` → `observation_generation_jobs` (outbox) → BullMQ worker → `observation` row. Idempotent enqueue, request-id propagation end-to-end, structured audit log.
- **API surface**: `POST /v1/events`, `POST /v1/sessions/start`, `POST /v1/sessions/:id/end`, generation-job list/retry/cancel, MCP routes, scoped reads.
- **Legacy compat**: `/api/sessions/observations` and `/api/sessions/summarize` shims map legacy worker payloads into the new event/job model without touching worker code. Both shims now wrap session lookup in their try/catch so Postgres failures return structured JSON, and `resolveServerSession` survives TOCTOU races via 23505 catch-and-refetch.
- **POST /v1/sessions/start** also catches 23505 on concurrent start with the same `externalSessionId` and refetches the winning row instead of returning 500.
- **Generation providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google with per-team-project scope enforcement and error classification.
- **Docker / Compose stack** and `bin/server-beta-cli` for local operator workflows.

### Bug fixes

- `resolveServerSession` Postgres errors no longer escape `asyncHandler.catch(next)` and return HTML 500s to legacy clients.
- `POST /v1/sessions/start` no longer returns 500 to the loser of a concurrent same-`externalSessionId` race.

Full PR thread: #2383.

## [13.0.1] - 2026-05-10

## Bug fixes

### MCP server
- **#2371** — drop `${_R%/}` parameter-expansion trim in `.mcp.json` that tripped Claude Code's MCP validator

### Environment isolation
- **#2357** — block `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` leak; use a three-branch OAuth-skip predicate
- Add `CLAUDE_MEM_ENV_FILE` lazy resolver so tests (and multi-profile users) can redirect the env-file path without module-load-order constraints

### Worker lifecycle
- Classify Claude SDK HTTP 400 as **unrecoverable** so the worker stops retrying a doomed request
- Stop hook crash hardened: `onclose` handler now performs background tree-kill on unexpected subprocess exit

### Chroma
- **#2313** — enforce a single `chroma-mcp` subprocess per worker (singleton via `disposeCurrentSubprocess()` on every code path; tree-kill of orphans on dispose)
- Pin `onnxruntime>=1.20` and `protobuf<7` to fix `INVALID_PROTOBUF` on macOS arm64

### Build
- Polyfill `import.meta.url` to `pathToFileURL(__filename)` in the CJS worker bundle so ESM-style code resolves correctly (CodeRabbit-driven follow-up)

### Tests / review
- `tests/env-isolation.test.ts` no longer mutates the real `~/.claude-mem/.env`; OAuth spy wrapped in try/finally to avoid leaks across runs
- 3 new chroma-mcp regression tests for #2313 (singleton enforcement)

### Misc
- Daily dependency bump per CLAUDE.md maintenance policy

## [13.0.0] - 2026-05-08

## Highlights

This is the **claude-mem 13** major release, landing the Server Beta runtime and the project's relicense.

### Server Beta runtime (opt-in)
- Independent server-beta service with its own lifecycle (`claude-mem server start/status/stop`)
- Postgres-backed observation storage
- BullMQ + Redis observation queue engine (gated behind `CLAUDE_MEM_QUEUE_ENGINE=bullmq`, fail-fast)
- New `/v1` REST API surface (events, sessions, memories, search, context, audit, jobs)
- API-key auth + Better-Auth proxy
- Outbox pattern for transactional event-to-job pipelines
- Generation-job primitives (`ServerJobQueue`, `ActiveServerBetaQueueManager`, deterministic colon-free SHA-256 job IDs)
- Docker Compose + E2E harness for the new stack

### Licensing
- Repository relicensed from **AGPL-3.0** to **Apache-2.0**
- `NOTICE` file added
- `docs/license.md` and `docs/ip-boundary.md` clarify the OSS / commercial boundary
- `ragtime/` subproject also relicensed to Apache-2.0

### Installer
- Server Beta is exposed as an installer option (default off — open-source core is unaffected)

## Migration notes
- Existing users on the worker-era plugin keep working — no breaking changes for the default install
- Server Beta is opt-in. Worker continues to run on its existing port and SQLite store.
- See `docs/migration-worker-to-server.md` for forward-looking migration guidance

## Compatibility
- Node ≥ 20, Bun ≥ 1.0
- Server Beta requires Postgres + Redis (only when enabled)

## [12.7.5] - 2026-05-07

Patch release for npx installs that hit an existing Codex marketplace registration.

Fixes:
- If Codex already has claude-mem-local registered from a different source, the installer now removes that stale registration and re-adds the local npx marketplace instead of failing.
- Keeps Codex plugin_hooks enablement and legacy AGENTS cleanup after the marketplace registration succeeds.
- Updates the release workflow instructions to use npm run build-and-sync instead of plain npm run build so the local marketplace and worker are synced during releases.

Validation:
- npm run build-and-sync
- bun test tests/install-non-tty.test.ts tests/infrastructure/plugin-distribution.test.ts tests/servers/mcp-tool-schemas.test.ts tests/setup-runtime.test.ts tests/hook-command.test.ts
- Docker smoke with codex-cli 0.128.0 reproducing the remote-to-local marketplace source conflict and verifying install completion.
- npx --yes claude-mem@12.7.5 --version

## [12.7.4] - 2026-05-07

Patch release for the Codex mem-search marketplace fix.

Highlights:
- Restores Codex access to the claude-mem MCP/search plugin by pointing the Codex marketplace at the bundled plugin root.
- Adds resilient MCP launcher fallbacks for local installs, Codex plugin cache installs, Claude plugin cache installs, and remote marketplace clones.
- Registers Codex plugin marketplaces during install, enables plugin_hooks, and cleans up legacy AGENTS-based Codex context injection.
- Includes the Codex session-start hook migration and Codex version-mismatch investigation plan.

Validation:
- npm run build
- bun test tests/install-non-tty.test.ts tests/infrastructure/plugin-distribution.test.ts tests/servers/mcp-tool-schemas.test.ts tests/setup-runtime.test.ts tests/hook-command.test.ts
- Docker smoke with codex-cli 0.128.0 for local install, remote marketplace add/upgrade, and MCP initialize.

## [12.7.3] - 2026-05-07

Patch release for the reliability fixes merged in PR #2344.

- Stops context-overflow and quota hard-stop failures from restarting observer generators and burning subscription quota.
- Makes Stop hook transcript lookup failures non-blocking, so missing worktree transcript paths do not re-wake Claude Code in a loop.
- Hardens MCP/plugin startup path resolution when host plugin-root environment variables are absent.
- Accepts legacy install markers while keeping new marker writes on the JSON format.
- Fixes export-memories to honor isolated data dirs, validate worker ports, and send the worker route's canonical session-id field.
- Makes pending_messages repair safer and removes stale worker_pid assumptions from the current queue/schema path.
- Adds a focused PR babysit status helper for low-noise review/check monitoring.

## [12.7.2] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Disable Claude Code built-in auto-memory during claude-code installs by setting `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` in Claude settings.
- Make JSON config writes crash-safe, durable, symlink-safe, and safe for dangling symlink destinations.
- Add regression coverage for atomic JSON writes through symlinked and dangling-symlink settings paths.

## [12.7.1] - 2026-05-06

## Added
- Package the new `babysit` skill for monitoring PR checks, review comments, and unresolved review threads until a PR is merge-ready.

## Verification
- `npm run build`
- `npm publish` completed for `claude-mem@12.7.1`

## [12.7.0] - 2026-05-06

## Added
- Add native Codex hooks integration through the Codex plugin marketplace.
- Add Codex hook payload normalization, file-context extraction, and Stop hook observation support.
- Add Codex installer support for `npx claude-mem@latest install` with Codex CLI version guidance.

## Fixed
- Avoid slow observation flow retries by replacing the worker-side initialization wait with hook-side readiness polling.
- Keep Codex file-context extraction from consuming boolean flags like `cat -n`.
- Include `bun-runner.js` in hook distribution verification.

## [12.6.4] - 2026-05-05

## Fixed
- Drain invalid/non-XML observer responses so pending agent observations are cleared instead of retrying forever (PR #2316 / issue #2315).
- Correct all plugin manifest versions so Claude, Codex, OpenClaw, bundled plugin, and npm metadata agree on 12.6.4.

## [12.6.5] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Installer now keeps the Claude Agent SDK as the single memory-agent path while supporting subscription auth, direct Anthropic API keys, and LiteLLM/custom gateway setup.
- Added gateway env support for `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` alongside `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.

### Fixed
- Removed the fixed agent-pool slot timeout so queued memory-agent work waits for process availability instead of dropping pending messages under load.
- Reset generator failures back to pending messages instead of clearing queued work.

## [12.6.2] - 2026-05-05

## Fix: `npx claude-mem@latest install` no longer hangs on tree-sitter-swift

### What broke in 12.6.1

PR #2300 moved 21 tree-sitter grammar packages from root `devDependencies` → root `dependencies`. As a result, `npx claude-mem@12.6.1 install` started fetching all 21 grammars at npx time. `tree-sitter-swift`'s postinstall pulled a nested `tree-sitter-cli` that downloads a Rust binary from GitHub and SIGINT'd the install:

```
npm error path .../node_modules/claude-mem/node_modules/tree-sitter-swift/node_modules/tree-sitter-cli
npm error command failed
npm error signal SIGINT
npm error Downloading https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases/download/v0.23.2/tree-sitter-macos-arm64.gz
```

npm doesn't honor the bun-only `trustedDependencies` allowlist, so postinstalls always run on a bare `npx` fetch.

### Fix (PR #2305)

Move the 21 grammar packages back to root `devDependencies`. The marketplace plugin install path is untouched — `plugin/package.json` keeps them as runtime deps and `bun install` (in `installPluginDependencies`) honors `trustedDependencies: ["tree-sitter-cli"]` to skip the harmful postinstalls on every other grammar. Smart-search/smart-outline/smart-unfold continue to work end-to-end.

PR #2300's `--legacy-peer-deps` and `--omit=dev` install.ts changes are kept — they fix a separate, valid marketplace ERESOLVE.

## [12.6.1] - 2026-05-05

## Patch release

### Fixed
- **install:** marketplace `npm install` no longer fails on tree-sitter peer-dep ERESOLVE. Tree-sitter grammar packages moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` and the install command updated to `--omit=dev --legacy-peer-deps` (#2300).
- **chroma-mcp:** removed ONNX/OpenBLAS thread cap from spawn env to restore performance on multi-core systems.

### Docs
- Documented the `--legacy-peer-deps` rationale in `runNpmInstallInMarketplace`.

## [12.6.0] - 2026-05-04

## Highlights

**17 issues fixed** and **4 new foundations** introduced via PR #2282 — a 24-cycle review-loop landed across 33 commits.

### New capabilities

- **OAuth keychain reader** (#2215) — `readClaudeOAuthToken()` reads from platform-native credential stores (macOS keychain, Windows DPAPI, Linux libsecret) at worker spawn-time. JWT exp / sidecar `expiresAt` validation refuses stale tokens. Re-login hint surfaced via SessionStart `additionalContext`.
- **Quota-aware wall-clock guard** (#2234) — new `RateLimitStore` with auth-type gate: `api_key` never aborts; cli/oauth aborts at per-window thresholds (5h:0.95, 7d_opus:0.93, 7d_sonnet:0.92). 15min reset-grace buffer with 0.85 utilization floor. `rateLimits` exposed on `/api/health`.
- **Network retry helper** (#2254) — `withRetry` honors `ClassifiedProviderError.kind`, exponential backoff with jitter, request-id capture for dedup logging.

### Foundations (new public modules)

- **F1 `spawnHidden`** (`src/shared/spawn.ts`) — `windowsHide: true` default; 8 spawn sites adopted.
- **F2 `paths`** (`src/shared/paths.ts`) — 24 hardcoded `homedir() + '.claude-mem'` sites collapsed into 18 named accessors. `CLAUDE_MEM_DATA_DIR` flows through 100% of runtime. Self-extending invariant test.
- **F3 `getUptimeSeconds`** (`src/shared/uptime.ts`) — fixes ms-bug at `Server.ts:165`.
- **F4 `ClassifiedProviderError`** (`src/services/worker/provider-errors.ts`) — `kind` union (`transient | unrecoverable | rate_limit | quota_exhausted | auth_invalid`); per-provider classifiers; `unrecoverablePatterns` allowlist deleted.

### Bug fixes

- #2188 — empty stdin no longer falls back to `'{}'`; diagnostic log + `CAPTURE_BROKEN` marker
- #2196 — `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` documentation added
- #2220 / #2253 — chroma-mcp CPU storm (Windows + macOS): thread caps, per-batch watermarks, telemetry off, `killProcessTree` on shutdown
- #2225 — opencode `_zod.def` crash: Zod schemas replace plain JSON-schema arg shapes
- #2231 — `SECURITY.md` at repo root populates GitHub Security tab
- #2233 — Part A: `stripCodeFences()` + fence example removed from prompt (Part B deferred)
- #2236 — observer agent visible windows on Windows (consumed F1)
- #2237 / #2238 — hardcoded paths (consumed F2)
- #2240 — dedupe `observationIds` before Chroma sync
- #2242 — `check-pending-queue.ts` points at `/api/processing-status` + `/api/processing`; honors `CLAUDE_MEM_WORKER_PORT`
- #2243 — `scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs` rsync excludes stale `scripts/package.json` + `scripts/node_modules`
- #2244 — `unrecoverablePatterns` allowlist deleted; worker dispatches on `error.kind`
- #2247 — Codex `task_complete` event added to session-end matched types
- #2248 — Cursor sessions never summarized: 3 bugs in stop→summarize path fixed (transcriptPath, type-only match, empty-text first-match) — 10-case regression test added
- #2250 — health endpoint uptime returns seconds (consumed F3)
- #2222 — `CLAUDE_CODE_PATH` desktop-app silent fail: rejects `Claude.exe` paths, falls back to real CLI binary

### Tests / CI

- 1454 pass / 77 fail — matches main baseline, zero net regressions
- All CI green: build, CodeRabbit (17 rounds resolved), Greptile (clean)

### Out of scope (deferred)

#2213 dual-queue avalanche, #2256 unbounded transcript retention, #2217 observation chunking, #2202 codex compression provider, #2249 Codex hook lifecycle migration, #2218 installer cache cleanup, #2167 parallel-agent throughput, #2191 Kiro IDE, #2212 Windows PTY, #2166 stable/beta channels.

## [12.5.1] - 2026-05-03

## Fixed

- **Install failure on Node 25+** — `bun install` no longer fails when trying to compile the unused `tree-sitter` runtime against Node 25's V8 headers (which require C++20). Added `trustedDependencies: ["tree-sitter-cli"]` to the plugin manifest so bun runs only the CLI's prebuilt-binary download script and skips all other lifecycle scripts — including the failing native compile and the unused `.node` bindings of all 24+ grammar packages. claude-mem only ever shells out to the prebuilt `tree-sitter-cli` Rust binary; the runtime native module was never imported. (#2278)

## Internal

- Sync the OpenClaw plugin manifest version (10.4.1 → 12.5.1) so it tracks with the rest of the package going forward; the version-bump skill already lists it but past releases skipped it.

## [12.5.0] - 2026-05-02

## Highlights

**Observation pipeline cleanup — kill the per-message retry counter.** The AI's parseable response is the only success signal; any other response (unparseable, empty, transport error) is a no-op. No more silent data loss after 3 retries.

## What changed

- **Parser:** collapsed to binary `{ valid: true, observations, summary } | { valid: false }`. No more `kind`/`skipped` enum dispatch in callers.
- **ResponseProcessor:** two branches only — parseable → store + clear pending → broadcast; not parseable → reset claimed-but-unprocessed messages to pending. Removed per-message FIFO popping and the summarize-special-case best-effort confirm.
- **PendingMessageStore:** 226 → 165 lines. Removed `markFailed` (the retry counter that silently dropped data after 3 attempts), `transitionMessagesTo`, `confirmProcessed`, `clearFailedOlderThan`, plus four other dead methods.
- **Provider cleanup:** removed `processingMessageIds` tracking from Claude, Gemini, OpenRouter providers. The session-scoped clear handles the success path; no per-message in-flight tracking needed.
- **GeneratorExitHandler:** drain-in-flight loop deleted; hard-stop / restart-guard paths now just clear pending for the session.
- **Schema migration v31 + v32:** dropped four dead columns from `pending_messages` — `retry_count`, `failed_at_epoch`, `completed_at_epoch`, `worker_pid`. Status enum reduced to `'pending' | 'processing'` (the unreachable `'processed'` and `'failed'` are gone).

## Bug fixes / polish

- **`SessionQueueProcessor`:** removed two arbitrary 1-second recovery sleeps after error in `claimNextMessage`/`waitForMessage`; let the iterator end cleanly so `GeneratorExitHandler` can restart it.
- **`Server.ts` + `SettingsRoutes.ts`:** unified four magic-number `setTimeout` exit-flush patterns (100ms × 2, 1000ms × 2) into one `flushResponseThen` helper using `res.on('finish', ...)`.
- **PR review feedback (21+ threads):** install.ts argument fixes, settings cache TTL, Dockerfile login-banner sourcing, docs port-model + Node version updates, regex whitespace fix, Date.UTC for year-mismatch test, sync-marketplace port range guard, banner inflate fail-open, version-bump arg validation.

## Net diff

`-181 lines` (worker-service.cjs unaffected; total source lines down).

## Migration

Existing databases auto-migrate on worker startup (schema v31 + v32 drop the dead columns). No user action needed.

## [12.4.9] - 2026-04-30

Patches in 7 critical fixes from PR #2219 (integration/critical-fixes-april):

- #2211 build/bundle drift — remove stale macOS binary + regen artifacts (closes #2158, #2200, #2154)
- #2204 strip privacy tags before summarization (closes #2149)
- #2205 preserve relevance order in semantic search (closes #2153)
- #2208 restore Windows spawn (PR #751 re-apply) + Windows CI

- #2206 isolate SDK boundary — close 6 issues at 3 call sites
- #2210 standalone batch — npm peer deps, marketplace self-heal, cache prune

## [12.4.8] - 2026-04-28

## Bug Fixes

- **timeline tool:** Coerce stringified numeric anchors (e.g. `"123"`) into the observation-ID dispatch path so they no longer fall through to ISO-timestamp parsing and return wrong-epoch windows. The HTTP layer always sends anchor as a string, so this fixes anchor lookups via MCP and HTTP across the board. (#2176)

## Tests

- Added a 7-case regression suite covering JS-number anchors, stringified-number anchors (incl. whitespace-padded), session-ID anchors (`S<n>`), ISO-timestamp anchors, garbage anchors, and explicit numeric-not-found behavior. The suite runs against a real in-memory SQLite `SessionStore` to exercise the full dispatch path.

## Refactors

- Extracted `parseNumericAnchor` helper in `SearchManager` to centralize anchor coercion across timeline handlers.

## [12.4.7] - 2026-04-26

## Cynical deletion + review fixes

This release wraps up the cynical-deletion sweep (PR #2141) — closing 27 issues by removing two anti-patterns that were breeding bugs:

- **Defenders** (orphan cleanup, duplicate liveness probes, restart-port-steal logic) replaced with fail-fast or single-source paths.
- **Tolerators** (silent JSON drops, drifted SSE/SQL filters, passthrough Zod schemas) replaced with strict boundaries.

### Highlights
- Multi-account isolation via `CLAUDE_MEM_DATA_DIR` + per-UID worker port (`37700 + uid % 100`), with `CLAUDE_MEM_WORKER_PORT` override (#2101)
- New `CLAUDE_MEM_INTERNAL=1` trust boundary replaces cwd-based observer-session detection
- Shared `shouldEmitProjectRow` predicate keeps SSE broadcast and pagination filters in sync
- Pinned `chroma-mcp` to 0.2.6 for reproducible installs
- Install/uninstall: shared `shutdown-helper` releases file locks before overwrite/delete (#2106)
- Migration 30: `observations.metadata` column added (#2116)
- Proxy env vars stripped from spawned subprocesses to prevent user proxy config leaking into AI API calls

### Review-comment fixes (post-PR)
- `worker-service` restart now exits 1 with error if `spawnDaemon` fails (Greptile P1)
- `shutdown-helper` distinguishes `AbortError` (slow worker) from connection-refused (gone) (Greptile P2)
- `hooks.json` `$HOME` cache lookup quoted to support paths with spaces
- `timeline-report` SKILL works on Windows (no `process.getuid()` requirement)
- `opencode-plugin` validates `CLAUDE_MEM_WORKER_PORT` before use
- `uninstall` only strips alias lines, not function declarations
- `MemoryRoutes` trims whitespace-only `project` before precedence resolution
- Migration 21 preserves `metadata` column when rebuilding observations table

### Closes
#2087, #2089, #2094, #2099, #2101, #2103, #2106, #2116, #2139, #2140, and 17 more (see PR #2141).

## [12.4.5] - 2026-04-26

## Bug Fixes

- **Fix observation persistence on fresh installs (#2139)**: `SessionStore` was missing migration 28's column additions, so freshly created `pending_messages` tables had no `tool_use_id` or `worker_pid` columns. Every queue claim and observation insert failed silently with "no such column" errors and nothing reached memory. Added `addPendingMessagesToolUseIdAndWorkerPidColumns` mirror in `SessionStore.ts` (matches the existing `addObservationSubagentColumns` / `addObservationsUniqueContentHashIndex` mirror pattern). Already-broken DBs at "v29 with no v28 columns" self-heal on next worker boot via column-existence guards. Dedup DELETE + UNIQUE index creation are now wrapped in a transaction matching the v29 mirror precedent.

Thanks to @drdah123 for the precise diagnosis and reproduction in the issue report.

## [12.4.4] - 2026-04-26

## Bug fix: stop draining the observation queue on /clear

When users typed `/clear` in Claude Code (or logged out, exited, or hit `prompt_input_exit`), every still-pending observation in the worker queue was being marked `abandoned` and never processed. The same shim was wired across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, the transcripts processor, OpenCode plugin, and OpenClaw — five surfaces, all draining the queue on what should be benign session-end signals.

This release removes the `SessionEnd → session-complete` hook entirely. The worker self-completes via its SDK-agent generator's finally-block, so no external completion call is needed. Pending observations now finish processing naturally instead of being abandoned.

Explicit user-initiated session deletion (via the viewer UI's `DELETE /api/sessions/:id`) still drains the queue — that's the only path that should.

### What changed

- Removed `SessionEnd` hook block from `plugin/hooks/hooks.json`
- Removed `POST /api/sessions/complete` route + Zod schema in `SessionRoutes.ts`
- Deleted `src/cli/handlers/session-complete.ts` and its registry entry
- Removed the call from `src/services/transcripts/processor.ts`
- Removed the call from the OpenCode plugin's `session.deleted` handler
- Removed the Gemini CLI installer's `SessionEnd → session-complete` mapping
- Removed `scheduleSessionComplete`, `pendingCompletionTimers`, and `completionDelayMs` from OpenClaw

### Background

This bug had been quietly draining queues since **November 7, 2025** (~6 months). The wiring crept in as a "cleanup hook stops the spinner" side effect (#4416), got rationalized as canonical architecture (#6682, #14793), and survived multiple refactors that preserved it instead of questioning it. Full timeline in PR #2136.

## [12.4.3] - 2026-04-25

One-time pollution cleanup migration plus the v12.4.1 / v12.4.2 ship-blocker fixes folded into a single release.

## Headline

**One-shot DB cleanup migration** (`CleanupV12_4_3.ts`) — runs once per data directory at worker startup, marker-file gated, opt-out via `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_CLEANUP_V12_4_3=1`. Cleans:
- `observer-sessions` rows that polluted user-facing search/timeline before the observer-sessions filter shipped (cascades to `user_prompts`, `observations`, `session_summaries`).
- Stuck `pending_messages` chains (≥10 rows per session in `failed`/`processing`) left over from the pre-v12.4.2 context-overflow loop.
- `~/.claude-mem/chroma/` and `chroma-sync-state.json` so `backfillAllProjects` rebuilds vectors from the cleaned SQLite.

Backups before any delete: `VACUUM INTO` first, with a `copyFileSync` fallback that also mirrors `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars so a WAL-mode restore is complete. Pre-flight `statfsSync` disk check before backup. The marker is only written after SQLite purges succeed; Chroma-wipe failures record the error on the marker rather than re-running the backup on every boot.

- **Context-overflow loop fix** (`SDKAgent.ts`): both overflow detection paths (`'prompt is too long'` / `'Prompt is too long'`) now clear `memorySessionId` and force a fresh session via the new `resetSessionForFreshStart` helper before aborting/throwing. Stops the infinite retry seen in pre-v12.4.2 logs.
- **`<task-notification>` storage leak** (`tag-stripping.ts` + `session-init.ts` + `SessionRoutes.ts`): dual-layer filter at the hook and at the worker HTTP boundary. `isInternalProtocolPayload` uses a tempered greedy body with negative lookahead so adjacent and surrounded protocol tags can't span across user text. 256 KB size guard before the regex prevents ReDoS on malformed payloads.

## v12.4.1 trivial fixes

- `mcpServers: {}` on `SDKAgent` and `KnowledgeAgent` spawns prevents host MCP server inheritance.
- `McpIntegrations.ts`: `.agent` → `.agents` path correction.
- `hooks.json`: `file-context` timeout `2000` → `60` (was 33 minutes); explicit `shell: bash` on hooks that use bash-only syntax.

## Cleanup-migration counts (sample run)

11 sessions + 3 cascade rows + 141 pending_messages purged in 1.1s; 277 MB pre-cleanup backup written.

## Tests

New: `tests/infrastructure/cleanup-v12_4_3.test.ts` — real on-disk SQLite under a tmpdir, exercises the happy path, idempotency, opt-out env var, no-DB marker, threshold-boundary preservation. Writing these tests caught a real counting bug (bun:sqlite `result.changes` inflates with FTS triggers) and the regex false positive (greedy `[\s\S]*` spanning two protocol blocks).

## Notes

- The migration is intentionally NOT atomic across the two transactions: if `runStuckPendingPurge` fails after `runObserverSessionsPurge` commits, the observer rows stay deleted and the cleanup retries on next boot. Both purges are idempotent.
- A user low on disk at first post-upgrade boot will retry on the next boot with adequate space (the marker is not written on disk-skip).

## [12.4.2] - 2026-04-25

## Two ship-blockers from yesterday's triage + 5 trivial fixes

### Worker reliability
- **Context overflow no longer loops forever.** When the Claude SDK throws `Prompt is too long`, `SDKAgent` now clears `session.memorySessionId` and sets `session.forceInit = true` before throwing — so the immediately-following crash-recovery spawn starts a fresh SDK session instead of resuming the same overflowed context. In the wild this had stranded 68+ pending messages on a single poisoned session before the windowed RestartGuard finally abandoned the queue.
- **`<task-notification>` payloads no longer pollute `user_prompts`.** Claude Code's autonomous protocol blocks (emitted on background `Agent` completion) were being captured as if they were user prompts — 471 such rows in one local DB. New `isInternalProtocolPayload()` predicate in `src/utils/tag-stripping.ts` blocks them at both the hook layer (`session-init.ts`) and the worker boundary (`SessionRoutes.ts`). Conservative deny-list — does NOT touch `<command-name>` / `<command-message>` which wrap real user slash-commands.

### Triage cleanup (from yesterday's open-issue review)
- **#2092**: `worker-service.cjs` build banner now CJS-safe (no `import.meta.url`); `node -c` passes for the first time in several releases.
- **#2100**: PreToolUse Read hook timeout reduced from `2000` (s, plainly a typo) to `60`.
- **#2131**: `"shell": "bash"` added to every hook in `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` so Claude Code on Windows routes through Git Bash instead of cmd.exe.
- **#2132**: Antigravity context file path corrected from `.agent/rules` to `.agents/rules`.
- **#2088**: Worker SDK `query()` calls now pass `mcpServers: {}` to suppress inheritance of the user's global MCP servers (Serena, etc.) into observer/knowledge sessions.

### Notes
- Cleanup of polluted rows is included in the worker — fresh installs are clean. To clean an existing DB: `sqlite3 ~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db "DELETE FROM user_prompts WHERE prompt_text LIKE '<task-notification>%';"` (the AFTER-DELETE trigger handles FTS).
- The 5 triage fixes were authored from a multi-agent review of 38 open issues against the v12.3.0–v12.4.1 cleanup arc.

## [12.4.1] - 2026-04-25

## perf(chroma): Cache backfill watermarks to skip per-restart Chroma scans

Worker restarts were re-scanning Chroma's full metadata for every project on every boot to determine which sqlite ids were already embedded. With ~253 projects and ~92k embeddings, this pegged `chroma-mcp` at 100–422% CPU on each spawn.

### What changed
- New `~/.claude-mem/chroma-sync-state.json` watermark cache — per-project highest synced sqlite_id for observations, summaries, and prompts.
- Backfill SQL changed from `id NOT IN (huge list)` to `id > watermark`.
- Live `syncObservation` / `syncSummary` / `syncUserPrompt` bump the watermark on success.
- One-time bootstrap derives initial watermarks from a single Chroma scan if the state file is missing — after that, Chroma metadata is never scanned again on startup.
- Watermark advances per batch, so partial-failure runs resume cleanly.

### Result
- Chroma CPU on worker restart: **422% → 0%**.
- State file size for 253 projects: **~3.7 KB**.
- Backfill startup time: **seconds → near-instant** after bootstrap.

## [12.3.9] - 2026-04-22

## Highlights

### 🔐 Security observation types + Telegram notifier
- New observation types: `security_alert` 🚨 (high-priority, triggers notifications) and `security_note` 🔐 (low-priority).
- Fire-and-forget Telegram notifier — MarkdownV2 formatting, per-observation error isolation, no token logging.
- Five env vars control behavior. `CLAUDE_MEM_TELEGRAM_ENABLED` master toggle defaults on (no-op without bot token + chat ID).

### ⚡ Stop hook: fire-and-forget summarize
- Eliminated the ~110s terminal block when a session ended. Summarize handler now enqueues and returns immediately.
- Server-side `SessionCompletionHandler` finalizes off the hook's critical path (generator + HTTP fallback), with singleton sharing across the worker.

### 🐛 Hooks: worker-port precedence + Windows (#2086 / PR #2084)
- Hooks now resolve endpoint with the same precedence as the worker: env (`CLAUDE_MEM_WORKER_PORT`, `CLAUDE_MEM_WORKER_HOST`) > settings.json > defaults.
- Looser sed regex handles both quoted and unquoted JSON port values.
- Windows fallback to 37777 when per-uid formula doesn't apply.

### 🔧 Bug fixes (reviewer rounds on PR #2084)
- Don't remove in-memory session after a failed finalize; preserve crash-recovery state at 3 sites.
- Eliminate double-broadcast of `session_completed` on fallback path.
- Sync `DatabaseManager.getSessionById` return type.
- `TelegramNotifier` now respects `settings.json` (not just env).
- Hardcoded 🚨 emoji replaced with per-type mapping.

### 📝 Docs
- `version-bump` skill now covers `npm publish` + all 6 manifest paths so `npx claude-mem@<version>` always resolves. Adds `git grep` pre-flight for new manifests.

### ⚙️ Chores

## [12.3.8] - 2026-04-21

## 🔧 Fix

**Detect PID reuse in the worker start-guard so containers can restart cleanly.** (#2082)

The `kill(pid, 0)` liveness check false-positived when the worker's PID file outlived its PID namespace — most commonly after `docker stop` / `docker start` with a bind-mounted `~/.claude-mem`. The new worker would boot as the same low PID (often 11) as the old one, `kill(0)` would report "alive," and the worker would refuse to start *against its own prior incarnation*. Symptom: container appeared to start, immediately exited cleanly with no user-visible error, worker never came up.

### What changed

- Capture an opaque **process-start identity token** alongside the PID and verify identity, not just liveness:
  - **Linux**: `/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22 (starttime in jiffies) — cheap, no exec, same signal `pgrep`/`systemd` use.
  - **macOS / POSIX**: `ps -p <pid> -o lstart=` with `LC_ALL=C` pinned so the emitted timestamp is locale-independent across environments.
  - **Windows**: unchanged — falls back to liveness-only. The PID-reuse scenario doesn't affect Windows deployments the way containers do.
- `verifyPidFileOwnership` emits a DEBUG log when liveness passes but the token mismatches, so the "PID reused" case is distinguishable from "process dead" in production logs.
- PID files written by older versions are token-less; `verifyPidFileOwnership` falls back to the existing liveness-only behavior for backwards compatibility. **No migration required.**

### Surface

Shared helpers (`PidInfo`, `captureProcessStartToken`, `verifyPidFileOwnership`) live in `src/supervisor/process-registry.ts` and are re-exported from `ProcessManager.ts` to preserve the existing public surface. Both entry points updated: `worker-service.ts` GUARD 1 and `supervisor/index.ts` `validateWorkerPidFile`.

### Tests

+14 new tests covering token capture, ownership verification, backwards compatibility for tokenless PID files, and the container-restart regression scenario. Zero regressions.

## [12.3.7] - 2026-04-20

## What's Changed

**Refactor: remove bearer auth and platform_source context filter** (#2081)

- Drop bearer-token auth from the worker API. Worker binds localhost-only and CORS restricts origins to localhost — the token added friction for every internal client (hooks, CLI, viewer, sync script) with no real security benefit for single-user local deployments.
- Drop the unused `platform_source` query-time filter from the `/api/context/inject` pipeline (ContextBuilder, ObservationCompiler, SearchRoutes, context handler, transcripts processor). The DB column stays — only the WHERE-clause filter and its plumbing are removed.
- Replace the removed auth with a simple in-memory rate limiter (300 req/min) as a lightweight compensating control. Limiter normalises IPv4-mapped IPv6, emits `Retry-After` on 429, and has a size-guarded prune that never runs on localhost.

## Cleanup

- Deleted `src/shared/auth-token.ts` and all its dependents (`worker-utils.ts` Authorization header, `ViewerRoutes.ts` token injection, CORS `allowedHeaders: ['Authorization']`, `sync-marketplace.cjs` admin restart header).
- Stopped tracking `.docker-blowout-data/claude-mem.db` and added the directory to `.gitignore`.

## Full Changelog
https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v12.3.6...v12.3.7

## [12.3.6] - 2026-04-20

## Viewer fix: drop the rate limiter

v12.3.5 kept the 300 req/min rate limiter from v12.3.3's "security hardening" bundle. That tripped the live viewer within seconds (it polls logs and stats) and served it "Rate limit exceeded" errors.

**Fix**: remove the rate limiter entirely. The worker is localhost-only (enforced via CORS), so there's no abuse surface to protect. Rate-limiting a single-user local process is security theater.

### Still kept from v12.3.3 hardening
- 5 MB JSON body limit
- Path traversal protection
- Localhost-only CORS
- Everything else from v12.3.5

No upgrade action required.

## [12.3.5] - 2026-04-20

## Restored v12.3.3 fixes minus bearer auth

v12.3.3 shipped 25 bug fixes under "Issue Blowout 2026" but also introduced bearer-token auth that broke SessionStart context injection for everyone. v12.3.4 rolled everything back to v12.3.2 to unblock users.

**v12.3.5 restores all 25 fixes**, with the bearer-auth mechanism surgically removed.

### Kept hardening from v12.3.3
- 5 MB JSON body limit
- In-memory rate limiter (300 req/min/IP)
- Path traversal protection on `watch.context.path`
- `RestartGuard` (time-windowed restart counter)
- Idle session eviction on pool slot allocation
- WAL checkpoint + `journal_size_limit`
- Periodic `clearFailed()` for pending_messages
- FTS5 keyword-search fallback when ChromaDB is unavailable
- `ResponseProcessor` marks non-XML responses as failed (with retry) instead of confirming
- `/health` reports `activeSessions`
- Summarize hook wraps `workerHttpRequest` in try/catch (no more blocking exit code 2)
- UserPromptSubmit session-init waits for worker health on Linux/WSL
- MCP loopback self-check uses `process.execPath` instead of bare `node`
- Nounset-safe `TTY_ARGS` in `docker/claude-mem/run.sh`

### Removed from v12.3.3
- `src/shared/auth-token.ts` (deleted)
- `requireAuth` middleware and its wiring in `Server.ts`/`Middleware.ts`
- `Authorization: Bearer` injection in `worker-utils.ts` (hook client), `ViewerRoutes.ts` (browser token injection), viewer `authFetch`, and the OpenCode plugin

### Upgrade notes
- `~/.claude-mem/worker-auth-token` from a previous 12.3.3 install is harmless and can be deleted.
- If your Claude Code session kept the 12.3.3 daemon alive, restart Claude Code once so the fresh 12.3.5 daemon takes over.

## [12.3.4] - 2026-04-20

## Rollback of v12.3.3

v12.3.3 (Issue Blowout 2026, PR #2080) broke SessionStart context injection — new sessions received no memory context from claude-mem. This release reverts to the v12.3.2 tree state while the regression is investigated.

### Reverted
- #2080 — Issue Blowout 2026 (25 bugs across worker, hooks, security, and search)

### Notes
No functional changes from v12.3.2. A follow-up release will re-land the v12.3.3 fixes individually once the context regression is identified and resolved.

## [12.3.3] - 2026-04-20

## Issue Blowout 2026 — 25 bugs across worker, hooks, security, and search

### Security Hardening
- Bearer token authentication for all worker API endpoints with auto-generated tokens
- Path traversal protection on context write paths
- Per-user worker port derivation (37700 + uid%100) to prevent cross-user data leakage
- Rate limiting (300 req/min/IP) and reduced JSON body limit (50MB → 5MB)
- Caller headers can no longer override the bearer auth token

### Worker Stability
- Time-windowed RestartGuard replaces flat counter — prevents stranding pending messages on long sessions
- Idle session eviction prevents pool slot deadlock when all slots are full
- MCP loopback self-check uses process.execPath instead of bare 'node'
- Age-scoped failed message purge (1h retention) instead of clearing all
- RestartGuard decay anchored to real successes, not object creation time

### Search & Chroma
- FTS5 keyword fallback when ChromaDB is unavailable for all search handlers
- doc_type:'observation' filter on Chroma queries feeding observation hydration
- Project filtering passed to Chroma queries and SQLite hydration in all endpoints
- Bounded post-import Chroma sync with concurrency limit of 8
- FTS5 MATCH input escaped as quoted literal phrases to prevent syntax errors
- LIKE metacharacters escaped in prompt text search
- date_desc ordering respected in FTS session search

### Hooks Reliability
- Summarize hook wrapped in try/catch to prevent exit code 2 on network failures
- Session-init gated on health check success — no longer runs when worker unreachable
- Health-check wait loop added to UserPromptSubmit for Linux/WSL startup race

### Database & Performance
- Periodic WAL checkpoint and journal_size_limit to prevent unbounded WAL growth
- FTS5 availability cached at construction time (no DDL probe per query)
- _fts5Available downgraded when FTS table creation fails

### Viewer UI
- response.ok check added to settings save and initial load flows
- Auth failure handling in saveSettings

## [12.3.2] - 2026-04-20

## Bug Fixes

- **Search**: Fix `concept`/`concepts` parameter mismatch in `/api/search/by-concept` (#1916)
- **Search**: Add FTS5 keyword fallback when ChromaDB is unavailable (#1913, #2048)
- **Database**: Add periodic `clearFailed()` to purge stale pending messages (#1957)
- **Database**: Add WAL checkpoint schedule and `journal_size_limit` to prevent unbounded growth (#1956)
- **Worker**: Mark messages as failed (with retry) instead of confirming on non-XML responses (#1874)
- **Worker**: Include `activeSessions` in `/health` endpoint for queue liveness monitoring (#1867)
- **Docker**: Fix nounset-safe `TTY_ARGS` expansion in `run.sh`
- **Search**: Cache `isFts5Available()` at construction time (Greptile review)

## [12.3.1] - 2026-04-20

## Error Handling & Code Quality

This patch release resolves error handling anti-patterns across the entire codebase (91 files), improving resilience and correctness.

### Bug Fixes

- **OpenRouterAgent**: Restored assistant replies to `conversationHistory` — multi-turn context was lost after method extraction (#2078)
- **ChromaSync**: Fixed cross-type dedup collision where `observation#N`, `session_summary#N`, and `user_prompt#N` could silently drop results
- **Timeline queries**: Fixed logger calls wrapping Error inside an object instead of passing directly
- **FTS migrations**: Preserved non-Error failure details instead of silently dropping them

### Error Handling Improvements

- Replaced 301 error handling anti-patterns across 91 files:
  - Narrowed overly broad try-catch blocks into focused error boundaries
  - Replaced unsafe `error as Error` casts with `instanceof` checks
  - Added structured error logging where catches were previously empty
  - Extracted large try blocks into dedicated helper methods
- **Installer resilience**: Moved filesystem operations (`mkdirSync`) inside try/catch in Cursor, Gemini CLI, Goose MCP, and OpenClaw installers to maintain numeric return-code contracts
- **GeminiCliHooksInstaller**: Install/uninstall paths now catch `readGeminiSettings()` failures instead of throwing past the `0/1` return contract
- **OpenClawInstaller**: Malformed `openclaw.json` now throws instead of silently returning `{}` and potentially wiping user config
- **WindsurfHooksInstaller**: Added null-safe parsing of `hooks.json` with optional chaining
- **McpIntegrations**: Goose YAML updater now throws when claude-mem markers exist but regex replacement fails
- **EnvManager**: Directory setup and existing-file reads are now wrapped in structured error logging
- **WorktreeAdoption**: `adoptedSqliteIds` mutation delayed until SQL update succeeds
- **Import script**: Guard against malformed timestamps before `toISOString()`
- **Runtime CLI**: Guard `response.json()` parsing with controlled error output

### Documentation

- Added README for Docker claude-mem harness

## [12.3.0] - 2026-04-20

## New features

### Basic claude-mem Docker container (`docker/claude-mem/`)
A ready-to-run container for ad-hoc claude-mem testing with zero local setup beyond Docker.

- `FROM node:20`; layers pinned Bun (1.3.12) + uv (0.11.7) + the built plugin
- Non-root `node` user so `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` works headlessly
- `build.sh`, `run.sh` (auto-extracts OAuth from macOS Keychain or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), `entrypoint.sh`
- Persistent `.claude-mem/` mount so the observations DB survives container exit

Validated end-to-end: `PostToolUse` hook → queue → worker SDK call under subscription OAuth → `<observation>` XML → `observations` table → Chroma sync.

### SWE-bench evaluation harness (`evals/swebench/`)
Two-container split (our agent image + the upstream SWE-bench harness) for measuring claude-mem's effect on resolve rate.

- `Dockerfile.agent` → `claude-mem/swebench-agent:latest` (same non-root, version-pinned approach)
- `run-instance.sh` — two-turn ingest/fix protocol per instance; shallow clone at `base_commit` with full-clone fallback
- `run-batch.py` — parallel orchestrator with OAuth extraction, per-container naming, timeout enforcement + force-cleanup, `--overwrite` guard against silent truncation of partial results
- `eval.sh` — wraps `python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation`
- `summarize.py` — aggregates per-instance reports
- `smoke-test.sh` — one-instance smoke test

### Fixes / hardening (from PR review)
- `chmod 600` on extracted OAuth creds files
- Grouped `{ chmod || true; }` so bash precedence can't mask failed `curl|sh` installs
- macOS creds: Keychain-first with file fallback for migrated / older setups
- `smoke-test.sh` `TIMEOUT` now actually enforced via `timeout`/`gtimeout` plus `docker rm -f` on exit 124
- Container naming + force-cleanup in `run-batch.py` timeout handler prevents orphan containers
- Fixed stdin-redirection collision in the consolidated `smoke-test.sh` JSON parser
- Drop `exec` in `run.sh` so the EXIT trap fires and cleans the temp creds file

**PR:** https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/pull/2076

## [12.2.3] - 2026-04-19

## Fixed

- **Parser: stop warning on normal observation responses (#2074).** Eliminated the `PARSER Summary response contained <observation> tags instead of <summary> — prompt conditioning may need strengthening` warning that fired on every normal observation turn. The warning was inherited from #1345 when `parseSummary` was only called after summary prompts; after #1633's refactor it runs on every response, so the observation-only fallthrough always tripped. Gated the entire observation-on-summary path on `coerceFromObservation` so only genuine summary-turn coercion failures log.

## [12.2.2] - 2026-04-19

## Subagent summary disable + labeling

Claude Code subagents (the Task tool and built-in agents like Explore/Plan/Bash) no longer trigger a session summary on Stop, and every observation row now carries the originating subagent's identity.

### Features

- **Subagent Stop hooks skip summarization.** When a hook fires inside a subagent (identified by `agent_id` on stdin), the handler short-circuits before bootstrapping the worker. Only the main assistant owns the session summary. Sessions started with `--agent` (which set `agent_type` but not `agent_id`) still own their summary.
- **Observations are labeled by subagent.** The `observations` table gains two new nullable columns — `agent_type` and `agent_id` — populated end-to-end from the hook stdin through the pending queue into storage. Main-session rows remain `NULL`. Labels survive worker restarts via matching columns on `pending_messages`.

### Safety

- Defense-in-depth guard on the worker `/api/sessions/summarize` route so direct API callers can't bypass the hook-layer short-circuit.
- `pickAgentField` type guard at the adapter edge validates the hook input: must be a non-empty string ≤128 characters, otherwise dropped.
- Content-hash dedup intentionally excludes `agent_type`/`agent_id` so the same semantic observation from a subagent and its parent merges to a single row.

### Schema

- Migration 010 (version 27) adds the two columns to `observations` and `pending_messages`, plus indexes on `observations.agent_type` and `observations.agent_id`. Idempotent, state-aware logging.

### Tests

- 17 new unit tests: adapter extraction (length cap boundary, empty-string rejection, type guards), handler short-circuit behavior, DB-level labeling and dedup invariants.

PR: #2073

## [12.2.1] - 2026-04-19

## What's Fixed

### Break infinite summary-retry loop (#1633)

When the summary agent returned `<observation>` tags instead of `<summary>` tags, the parser rejected the response, no summary was stored, the session completed without a summary, and a new session was spawned with ~5–6 KB of extra prompt context — repeating indefinitely.

**Three layers of defense (PR #2072):**

- **Parser coercion** — when a summary is expected, observation fields are mapped to summary fields (title → request/completed, narrative → investigated, facts → learned) instead of discarding the response.
- **Stronger prompt** — summary prompts now include an explicit tag-requirement block and a closing reminder so the LLM is much less likely to emit observation tags in the first place.
- **Circuit breaker** — per-session counter caps consecutive summary failures at 3; further summarize requests are skipped until a success resets it. Explicit `<skip_summary/>` responses are treated as neutral, not failures.

**Edge cases handled:**

- Empty leading `<observation>` blocks fall through to the first populated one.
- Empty `<summary></summary>` wrappers fall back to observation coercion.
- Multiple observation blocks are iterated via a global regex.

Full details: #2072

## [12.2.0] - 2026-04-18

## Highlights

**Worktree Adoption** — When a git worktree is merged back into its parent branch, its observations are now consolidated into the parent project's view, so memory follows the code after a merge.

## Features

- **Worktree adoption engine** — consolidates merged-worktree observations under the parent project (#2052)
- **`npx claude-mem adopt`** — new CLI command with `--dry-run` and `--branch X` flags for manual adoption
- **Auto-adoption on worker startup** — merged worktrees are adopted automatically when the worker service starts
- **CWD-based project remap** — project identity derived from `pending_messages.cwd`, applied on worker startup
- **Parent + worktree read scope** — worktree sessions now include parent repo observations in their read scope
- **Composite project names** — parent/worktree naming prevents observations from crossing worktrees
- **Merged-into-parent badge** — UI now flags observations that have been adopted from a merged worktree
- **Observer-sessions project hidden** — internal bookkeeping project no longer appears in UI lists

## Fixes

- Drop orphan flag when filtering empty-string spawn args (#2049)
- Self-heal Chroma metadata on re-run
- Schema guard, startup adoption path, and query parity hardening
- Git operation timeouts + dry-run sentinel fixes
- Context derivation uses explicit `projects` array rather than cwd

## Chores

- Removed auto-generated per-directory `CLAUDE.md` files across the tree

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v12.1.6...v12.2.0

## [12.1.6] - 2026-04-16

## Fix

**Critical regression fix (#2049): observations no longer save on Claude Code 2.1.109+**

Resolves 100% observation/summary failure on Claude Code 2.1.109+ caused by a latent bug in how the bundled Agent SDK emits the `--setting-sources` flag.

### Root cause

The Agent SDK emits `["--setting-sources", ""]` whenever `settingSources` defaults to `[]`. Our existing Bun-compat filter stripped the empty string but left an orphan `--setting-sources` flag, which then consumed the following `--permission-mode` as its value. Claude Code 2.1.109+ rejects this with:

```
Error processing --setting-sources:
  Invalid setting source: --permission-mode.
```

Every observation SDK spawn crashed with exit code 1 before any data could be written.

### Fix

`ProcessRegistry.createPidCapturingSpawn` now uses a pair-aware filter: when an empty-string arg follows a `--flag`, both are dropped together. The SDK default (no setting sources) is preserved by omission.

### Credits

Thanks to @GigiTiti-Kai for the detailed root-cause report in #2049.

## [12.1.5] - 2026-04-15

Users on v12.1.3 experience 100% observation failure due to empty-string arg filtering corrupting `--setting-sources` on Claude Code 2.1.109+. The fix already landed in v12.1.4 (commit 3d92684 — `fix: filter empty string args before Bun spawn()`). This release forces the update to propagate across npm and the marketplace so every user gets the fix.

## Backlog cleanup
Also shipped earlier today: the April 2026 backlog consolidation merged 93 PRs and 147 issues into 138 clean tracking issues (95 bugs, 43 feature requests).

## Upgrade
```bash
npm install -g claude-mem@12.1.5
```

## [12.1.4] - 2026-04-15

## Bug Fixes

- **Revert unauthorized $CMEM branding**: A prior Claude instance inserted `$CMEM` token branding into the context injection header during a compression refactor. Reverted back to the original descriptive format: `# [project] recent context, datetime`

## [12.1.3] - 2026-04-15

## What's Changed

### Reverted
- **Remove overengineered summary salvage logic** (#1850) — Reverts PR #1718 which fabricated synthetic summaries from observation data when the AI returned `<observation>` instead of `<summary>` tags. Missing a summary is preferable to creating a fake one with poorly-mapped fields.

## [12.1.1] - 2026-04-15

14 community PRs merged + 1 post-merge bug fix. This patch addresses the most impactful bugs across summary persistence, MCP compliance, cross-platform compatibility, and data integrity.

### Highlights

**Summary pipeline fix** — When the LLM returns `<observation>` tags instead of `<summary>` tags (~72% of the time on v12.0.x), data is now salvaged into a synthetic summary instead of being silently discarded. (#1718)

**MCP compliance** — `list_corpora` now returns proper `CallToolResult` objects instead of bare arrays that crashed MCP clients. Search and timeline tools now declare `inputSchema.properties`. (#1701, #1555)

**Data integrity** — Ghost observations with no content fields are now filtered before storage. Search queries are now scoped to the current project via `WHERE project = ?`. (#1676, #1688... wait, #1688 wasn't in this batch)

### Bug Fixes

## [12.1.0] - 2026-04-09

## Knowledge Agents

Build queryable AI "brains" from your claude-mem observation history. Compile a filtered slice of your past work into a corpus, prime it into a Claude session, and ask questions conversationally — getting synthesized, grounded answers instead of raw search results.

### New Features

- **Knowledge Agent system** — full lifecycle: build, prime, query, reprime, rebuild, delete
- **6 new MCP tools**: `build_corpus`, `list_corpora`, `prime_corpus`, `query_corpus`, `rebuild_corpus`, `reprime_corpus`
- **8 new HTTP API endpoints** on the worker service (`/api/corpus/*`)
- **CorpusBuilder** — searches observations, hydrates full records, calculates stats, persists to `~/.claude-mem/corpora/`
- **CorpusRenderer** — renders observations into full-detail prompt text for the 1M token context window
- **KnowledgeAgent** — manages Agent SDK sessions with session resume for multi-turn Q&A
- **Auto-reprime** — expired sessions are automatically reprimed and retried (only for session errors, not all failures)
- **Knowledge agent skill** (`/knowledge-agent`) for guided corpus creation

### Security & Robustness

- Path traversal prevention in CorpusStore (alphanumeric name validation + resolved path check)
- System prompt hardened against instruction injection from untrusted corpus content
- Runtime name validation on all MCP corpus tool handlers
- Question field validated as non-empty string
- Session state only persisted after successful prime (not null on failure)
- Refreshed session_id persisted after query execution
- E2e curl wrappers hardened with connect-timeout and transport failure fallback

### Documentation

- New docs page: Knowledge Agents usage guide with Quick Start, architecture diagram, filter reference, and API reference
- Knowledge agent skill page with workflow examples
- Added to docs navigation

### Testing

- Comprehensive e2e test suite (31 tests) covering full corpus lifecycle

## [12.0.1] - 2026-04-08

## 🔴 Hotfix: MCP server crashed with `Cannot find module 'bun:sqlite'` under Node

v12.0.0 shipped a broken MCP server bundle that crashed on the very first `require()` call because a transitive import pulled `bun:sqlite` (a Bun-only module) into a bundle that runs under Node. Every MCP-only client (Codex and any flow that boots the MCP tool surface) was completely broken on v12.0.0.

### Root cause

`src/servers/mcp-server.ts` imported `ensureWorkerStarted` from `worker-service.ts`, which transitively pulled in `DatabaseManager` → `bun:sqlite`. The bundle ballooned from ~358KB (v11.0.1) to ~1.96MB (v12.0.0) and `node mcp-server.cjs` immediately threw `Error: Cannot find module 'bun:sqlite'`.

### Fix

- **Extracted** `ensureWorkerStarted` and Windows spawn-cooldown helpers into a new lightweight `src/services/worker-spawner.ts` module that has zero database/SQLite/ChromaDB imports
- **Wired** `mcp-server.ts` and `worker-service.ts` through the new module via a thin back-compat wrapper
- **Fixed** `resolveWorkerRuntimePath()` to find Bun on every platform (not just Windows) so the MCP server running under Node can correctly spawn the worker daemon under Bun
- **Added** two build-time guardrails in `scripts/build-hooks.js`:
  - Regex check: fails the build if `mcp-server.cjs` ever contains a `require("bun:*")` call
  - Bundle size budget: fails the build if `mcp-server.cjs` exceeds 600KB
- **Improved** error messages when Bun cannot be located (now names the install URL and explains *why* Bun is required)
- **Validated** `workerScriptPath` at the spawner entry point with empty-string and existsSync guards
- **Memoized** `resolveWorkerRuntimePath()` to skip repeated PATH lookups during crash loops, while never caching the not-found result so a long-running MCP server can recover if Bun is installed mid-session

### Verification

- `node mcp-server.cjs` exits cleanly under Node
- JSON-RPC `initialize` + `tools/list` + `tools/call search` all succeed end-to-end
- Bundle is back to ~384KB with zero `require("bun:sqlite")` calls
- 47 unit tests pass (44 ProcessManager + 3 worker-spawner)
- Both build guardrails verified to trip on simulated regressions
- Smoke test: MCP server serves the full 7-tool surface

### What this means for users

- **MCP-only clients (Codex, etc.):** v12.0.0 was broken; v12.0.1 restores full functionality
- **Claude Code users:** worker startup via the SessionStart hook continued working under Bun on v12.0.0, but the MCP tool surface (`mem-search`, `timeline`, `get_observations`, `smart_*`) was unreliable. v12.0.1 fixes that completely.
- **Plugin developers:** new build-time guardrails prevent this regression class from shipping again

## [12.0.0] - 2026-04-07

# claude-mem v12.0.0

A major release delivering intelligent file-read gating, expanded language support for smart-explore, platform source isolation, and 40+ bug fixes across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Highlights

### File-Read Decision Gate
Claude Code now intelligently gates redundant file reads. When a file has prior observations in the timeline, the PreToolUse hook injects the observation history and blocks the read — saving tokens and keeping context focused. The gate supports both `Read` and `Edit` tools, uses `permissionDecision` deny with a rich timeline payload, and includes file-size thresholds and observation deduplication.

### Smart-Explore: 24 Language Support
The `smart-explore` skill now supports **24 programming languages** via tree-sitter AST parsing: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Scala, Bash, CSS, SCSS, HTML, Lua, Haskell, Elixir, Zig, TOML, and YAML. User-installable grammars with `--legacy-peer-deps` support for tree-sitter version conflicts.

### Platform Source Isolation
Claude and Codex sessions are now fully isolated with `platform_source` column on `sdk_sessions`. Each platform gets its own session namespace, preventing cross-contamination between different AI coding tools. Normalized at route boundaries for consistent behavior.

### Codex & OpenClaw Support
- Codex plugin manifest added for marketplace discoverability
- OpenClaw: `workerHost` config for Docker deployments
- OpenClaw: handle stale `plugins.allow` and non-interactive TTY in installer

## New Features

- **File-read decision gate** — blocks redundant file reads with observation timeline injection (#1564, #1629, #1641)
- **24-language smart-explore** — AST-based code exploration across all major languages
- **Platform source isolation** — Claude/Codex session namespacing with DB migration
- **CLAUDE.local.md support** — `CLAUDE_MEM_FOLDER_USE_LOCAL_MD` setting for writing to local-only config
- **OpenClaw workerHost** — Docker deployment support for OpenClaw plugin
- **Codex plugin manifest** — discoverability in Codex marketplace
- **File-size threshold** — skip file-read gating for small files
- **Observation deduplication** — prevent duplicate observations in timeline gate

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v11.0.1...v12.0.0

## [11.0.1] - 2026-04-06

**Patch release** — Changes `CLAUDE_MEM_SEMANTIC_INJECT` default from `true` to `false`.

### What changed
- Per-prompt Chroma vector search on `UserPromptSubmit` is now **opt-in** rather than opt-out
- Reduces latency and context noise for users who haven't explicitly enabled it
- Users can re-enable via `CLAUDE_MEM_SEMANTIC_INJECT=true` in `~/.claude-mem/settings.json`

### Why
The semantic inject fires on every prompt and often surfaces tangentially related observations. A more precise file-context approach (PreToolUse timeline gate) is in development as a replacement.

## [11.0.0] - 2026-04-05

## claude-mem v11.0.0

**4 releases today** · 21 commits · 6,051 insertions · 34 files changed

### Features

#### Semantic Context Injection (#1568)
Every `UserPromptSubmit` now queries ChromaDB for the top-N most relevant past observations and injects them as context. Replaces recency-based "last N observations" with relevance-based semantic search. Survives `/clear`, skips trivial prompts (<20 chars), and degrades gracefully when Chroma is unavailable.

#### Tier Routing by Queue Complexity
The SDK agent now inspects pending queue complexity before selecting a model. Simple tool-only queues (Read, Glob, Grep) route to Haiku; mixed/complex queues use the default model. Production result: **~52% cost reduction** on SDK agent usage with quality indistinguishable from Sonnet. Includes a new `observation_feedback` table for future Thompson Sampling optimization.

#### Multi-Machine Observation Sync (#1570)
New `claude-mem-sync` CLI with `push`, `pull`, `sync`, and `status` commands. Bidirectional sync of observations and session summaries between machines via SSH/SCP with deduplication by `(created_at, title)`. Tested syncing 3,400+ observations between two physical servers — a session on the remote machine used transferred memory to deliver a real feature PR.

#### Orphaned Message Drain (#1567)
When `deleteSession()` aborts the SDK agent via SIGTERM, pending messages are now marked abandoned instead of remaining in `pending` status forever. Production evidence: 15 orphaned messages found before fix → 0 orphaned messages over 23 days after fix.

### Bug Fixes

#### Installer Regression Fixed (v10.7.0 → v10.7.1)
The install simplification in v10.7.0 over-applied scope — it replaced the entire `runInstallCommand` with just two `claude` CLI commands, gutting the interactive IDE multi-select, `--ide` flag, and all 13 IDE-specific setup dispatchers. v10.7.1 restores the full installer for all non-Claude-Code IDEs while keeping the native plugin delegation for Claude Code.

#### 3 Upstream Production Bugs (#1566)
Found via analysis of 543K log lines over 17 days across two servers:
- **summarize.ts**: Skip summary when transcript has no assistant message (was causing ~30 errors/day)
- **ChromaSync.ts**: Fallback to `chroma_update_documents` when add fails with "IDs already exist"
- **HealthMonitor.ts**: Replace HTTP-based port check with atomic socket bind (eliminates TOCTOU race on simultaneous session starts)

#### Other Fixes
- Concept-type cleanup log downgraded from error to debug (reduces log noise)

### Breaking Change

**Strict Observer Response Contract** — The memory agent can no longer return prose-style skip responses like "Skipping — no substantive tool executions." `buildObservationPrompt` now requires `<observation>` XML blocks or an empty response. `ResponseProcessor` warns when non-XML content is received. This prevents silent data loss from the observer deciding on its own that tool output isn't worth recording.

### Community

Features in this release were contributed by **Alessandro Costa** ([@alessandropcostabr](https://github.com/alessandropcostabr)) — semantic injection, tier routing, multi-machine sync, orphan drain, and the 3-bug production fix. All PRs include production data from real multi-server deployments.

### Release History

This release consolidates v10.7.0 through v11.0.0, all shipped on April 4, 2026. For the full v10.x era (267 commits, 39 releases), see [v10.7.0](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/releases/tag/v10.7.0) and earlier.

## [10.7.2] - 2026-04-05

## Bug Fix

- **fix**: Downgrade concept-type cleanup log from error to debug (#1606) — reduces noise in logs by treating routine concept-type cleanup as debug-level rather than error-level logging.

## [10.7.1] - 2026-04-05

## Bug Fix

**Restore full interactive installer** — the install simplification in v10.7.0 (commit 21b10b46) over-applied scope and replaced the entire `runInstallCommand` with just two `claude` CLI commands. This gutted the interactive IDE multi-select, `--ide` flag, and all 13 IDE-specific setup dispatchers.

### What changed
- **Claude Code**: now uses native `claude plugin marketplace add` + `claude plugin install` (the intended simplification)
- **All other IDEs** (Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Windsurf, OpenClaw, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, Antigravity, Goose, Crush, Roo Code, Warp): full installer flow restored — file copy, marketplace registration, interactive multi-select via `@clack/prompts`, and IDE-specific setup
- `--ide <id>` flag works again for direct IDE targeting

## [10.7.0] - 2026-04-04

## What's New

### Simplified Installation
- Install command now delegates to native Claude Code plugin system: `claude plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem && claude plugin install claude-mem`
- Reduced install.ts from 536 lines to 36 lines

### Multi-IDE Support (NPX CLI)
- Gemini CLI hooks installer with lifecycle event mapping
- Windsurf hooks installer with project registry and context injection
- OpenCode plugin installer with AGENTS.md context injection
- OpenClaw plugin installer
- Codex CLI transcript watcher integration
- MCP factory pattern for Copilot CLI, Antigravity, Goose, Crush, Roo Code, Warp

### Uninstall Improvements
- Worker shutdown now waits for process exit before file deletion
- IDE-specific hooks and config are cleaned up during uninstall

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed bundle path resolution using `import.meta.url` instead of `process.cwd()`
- Fixed Windsurf registry key collision for same-named workspace directories
- AGENTS.md injection failures now logged instead of silently swallowed
- Session tracking Map capped at 1000 entries to prevent memory leaks
- Fixed double-shebang in NPX CLI bundle
- Fixed corrupt JSON handling in Gemini CLI status command

### Other
- Restored version-bump skill for future releases
- Added IDE context files for Windsurf, Warp, Copilot, and agent rules

## [10.6.3] - 2026-03-29

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix MCP server crash**: Removed erroneous `import.meta.url` ESM-compat banner from CJS files that caused Node.js startup failures
- **Fix 7 critical bugs** affecting all non-dev-machine users and Windows:
  - Hook registration paths corrected for plugin distribution
  - Worker service spawn handling hardened for Windows
  - Environment sanitization for cross-platform compatibility
  - ProcessManager Windows spawn catch block improvements
  - SessionEnd inline hook exemption in regression tests
  - `summarize.ts` warning log now includes `sessionId` for triage
- **CodeRabbit review feedback** addressed from PR #1518

### Improvements

- **Gemini CLI integration**: Strip ANSI color codes from timeline display, provide markdown fallback

### Files Changed

- `plugin/hooks/hooks.json`
- `plugin/scripts/mcp-server.cjs`
- `plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs`
- `scripts/build-hooks.js`
- `src/cli/handlers/summarize.ts`
- `src/services/infrastructure/ProcessManager.ts`

- `tests/supervisor/env-sanitizer.test.ts`

## [10.6.2] - 2026-03-21

## fix: Activity spinner stuck spinning forever

The viewer UI activity spinner would spin indefinitely because `isAnySessionProcessing()` queried all pending/processing messages in the database globally — including orphaned messages from dead sessions that no generator would ever process. These orphans caused `isProcessing=true` forever.

### Changes

- Scoped `isAnySessionProcessing()` and `hasPendingMessages()` to only check sessions in the active in-memory Map, so orphaned DB messages no longer affect the spinner
- Added `terminateSession()` method enforcing a restart-or-terminate invariant — every generator exit must either restart or fully clean up
- Fixed 3 zombie paths in the `.finally()` handler that previously left sessions alive in memory with no generator running
- Fixed idle-timeout race condition where fresh messages arriving between idle abort and cleanup could be silently dropped
- Removed redundant bare `isProcessing: true` broadcast and eliminated double-iteration in `broadcastProcessingStatus()`
- Replaced inline `require()` with proper accessor via `sessionManager.getPendingMessageStore()`
- Added 8 regression tests for session termination invariant

## [10.6.1] - 2026-03-18

### New Features
- **Timeline Report Skill** — New `/timeline-report` skill generates narrative "Journey Into [Project]" reports from claude-mem's development history with token-aware economics
- **Git Worktree Detection** — Timeline report automatically detects git worktrees and uses parent project as data source
- **Compressed Context Output** — Markdown context injection compressed ~53% (tables → compact flat lines), reducing token overhead in session starts
- **Full Observation Fetch** — Added `full=true` parameter to `/api/context/inject` for fetching all observations

### Improvements
- Split `TimelineRenderer` into separate markdown/color rendering paths
- Fixed timestamp ditto marker leaking across session summary boundaries

### Security
- Removed arbitrary file write vulnerability (`dump_to_file` parameter)

## [10.6.0] - 2026-03-18

## OpenClaw: System prompt context injection

The OpenClaw plugin no longer writes to `MEMORY.md`. Instead, it injects the observation timeline into each agent's system prompt via the `before_prompt_build` hook using `appendSystemContext`. This keeps `MEMORY.md` under the agent's control for curated long-term memory. Context is cached for 60 seconds per project.

## New `syncMemoryFileExclude` config

Exclude specific agent IDs from automatic context injection (e.g., `["snarf", "debugger"]`). Observations are still recorded for excluded agents — only the context injection is skipped.

## Fix: UI settings now preserve falsy values

The viewer settings hook used `||` instead of `??`, which silently replaced backend values like `'0'`, `'false'`, and `''` with UI defaults. Fixed with nullish coalescing. Frontend defaults now aligned with backend `SettingsDefaultsManager`.

## Documentation

- Updated `openclaw-integration.mdx` and `openclaw/SKILL.md` to reflect system prompt injection behavior
- Fixed "prompt injection" → "context injection" terminology to avoid confusion with the OWASP security term

## [10.5.6] - 2026-03-16

## Patch: Process Supervisor Hardening & Logging Cleanup

### Fixes
- **Downgrade HTTP request/response logging from INFO to DEBUG** — eliminates noisy per-request log spam from the viewer UI polling
- **Fix `isPidAlive(0)` returning true** — PID 0 is the kernel scheduler, not a valid child process
- **Fix signal handler race condition** — added `shutdownInitiated` flag to prevent duplicate shutdown cascades when signals arrive before `stopPromise` is set
- **Remove unused `dataDir` parameter** from `ShutdownCascadeOptions`
- **Export and reuse env sanitizer constants** — `Server.ts` now imports `ENV_PREFIXES`/`ENV_EXACT_MATCHES` from `env-sanitizer.ts` instead of duplicating them
- **Rename `zombiePidFiles` to `deadProcessPids`** — now returns actual PID array instead of a boolean
- **Use `buildWorkerUrl` helper** in `workerHttpRequest` instead of inline URL construction
- **Remove unused `getWorkerPort` imports** from observation and session-init handlers
- **Upgrade `reapSession` failure log** from debug to warn level
- **Clean up `.gitignore`** — remove stale `~*/`, `http*/`, `https*/` patterns and duplicate `datasets/` entry

### Tests
- Rewrote supervisor index tests to use temp directories instead of relying on real `~/.claude-mem/worker.pid`
- Added deterministic test cases for missing, invalid, stale, and alive PID file states
- Removed unused `dataDir` from shutdown test fixtures

## [10.5.5] - 2026-03-09

### Bug Fix

- **Fixed empty context queries after mode switching**: Switching from a non-code mode (e.g., law-study) back to code mode left stale observation type/concept filters in `settings.json`, causing all context queries to return empty results. All modes now read types/concepts from their mode JSON definition uniformly.

### Cleanup

- Removed dead `CLAUDE_MEM_CONTEXT_OBSERVATION_TYPES` and `CLAUDE_MEM_CONTEXT_OBSERVATION_CONCEPTS` settings constants
- Deleted `src/constants/observation-metadata.ts` (no longer needed)
- Removed observation type/concept filter UI controls from the viewer's Context Settings modal

## [10.5.4] - 2026-03-09

## Bug Fixes

- **fix: restore modes to correct location** — All modes (`code`, code language variants, `email-investigation`) were erroneously moved from `plugin/modes/` to `plugin/hooks/modes/` during the v10.5.3 release, breaking mode loading. This patch restores them to `plugin/modes/` where they belong.

## [10.5.3] - 2026-03-09

## What's New

### Law Study Mode

Adds `law-study` — a purpose-built claude-mem mode for law students.

**Observation Types:**
- **Case Holding** — 2-3 sentence brief with extracted legal rule
- **Issue Pattern** — exam trigger or fact pattern that signals a legal issue
- **Prof Framework** — professor's analytical lens and emphasis for a topic
- **Doctrine / Rule** — legal test or standard synthesized from cases/statutes
- **Argument Structure** — legal argument or counter-argument worked through analytically
- **Cross-Case Connection** — insight linking cases or doctrines to reveal a deeper principle

**Concepts (cross-cutting tags):**
`exam-relevant` · `minority-position` · `gotcha` · `unsettled-law` · `policy-rationale` · `course-theme`

**Chill Variant** — `law-study--chill` records only high-signal items: issue patterns, gotchas, and professor frameworks. Skips routine case holdings unless the result is counterintuitive.

**CLAUDE.md Template** — `law-study-CLAUDE.md` is a drop-in template for any law study project directory. It configures Claude as a Socratic legal study partner: precise case briefs, critical document analysis, issue spotting, and doctrine synthesis — without writing exam answers for the student.

Activate with: `/mode law-study` or `/mode law-study--chill`

## [10.5.2] - 2026-02-26

## Smart Explore Benchmark Docs & Skill Update

### Documentation
- Published smart-explore benchmark report to public docs — full A/B comparison with methodology, raw data tables, quality assessment, and decision framework
- Added benchmark report to docs.json navigation under Best Practices

### Smart Explore Skill
- Updated token economics with benchmark-accurate data (11-18x savings on exploration, 4-8x on file understanding)
- Added "map first" core principle as decision heuristic for tool selection
- Added AST completeness guarantee to smart_unfold documentation (never truncates, unlike Explore agents)
- Added Explore agent escalation guidance for multi-file synthesis tasks
- Updated smart_unfold token range from ~1-7k to ~400-2,100 based on measurements
- Updated Explore agent token range from ~20-40k to ~39-59k based on measurements

## [10.5.1] - 2026-02-26

### Bug Fix

- Restored hooks.json to pre-smart-explore configuration (re-adds Setup hook, separate worker start command, PostToolUse matcher)

## [10.5.0] - 2026-02-26

## Smart Explore: AST-Powered Code Navigation

This release introduces **Smart Explore**, a token-optimized structural code search system built on tree-sitter AST parsing. It applies the same progressive disclosure pattern used in human-readable code outlines — but programmatically, for AI agents.

### Why This Matters

The standard exploration cycle (Glob → Grep → Read) forces agents to consume entire files to understand code structure. A typical 800-line file costs ~12,000 tokens to read. Smart Explore replaces this with a 3-layer progressive disclosure workflow that delivers the same understanding at **6-12x lower token cost**.

### 3 New MCP Tools

- **`smart_search`** — Walks directories, parses all code files via tree-sitter, and returns ranked symbols with signatures and line numbers. Replaces the Glob → Grep discovery cycle in a single call (~2-6k tokens).
- **`smart_outline`** — Returns the complete structural skeleton of a file: all functions, classes, methods, properties, imports (~1-2k tokens vs ~12k for a full Read).
- **`smart_unfold`** — Expands a single symbol to its full source code including JSDoc, decorators, and implementation (~1-7k tokens).

### Token Economics

| Approach | Tokens | Savings |
|----------|--------|---------|
| smart_outline + smart_unfold | ~3,100 | 8x vs Read |
| smart_search (cross-file) | ~2,000-6,000 | 6-12x vs Explore agent |
| Read (full file) | ~12,000+ | baseline |
| Explore agent | ~20,000-40,000 | baseline |

### Language Support

10 languages via tree-sitter grammars: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, Ruby, PHP.

### Other Changes

- Simplified hooks configuration
- Removed legacy setup.sh script
- Security fix: replaced `execSync` with `execFileSync` to prevent command injection in file path handling

## [10.4.4] - 2026-02-26

## Fix

- **Remove `save_observation` from MCP tool surface** — This tool was exposed as an MCP tool available to Claude, but it's an internal API-only feature. Removing it from the MCP server prevents unintended tool invocation and keeps the tool surface clean.

## [10.4.3] - 2026-02-25

## Bug Fixes

- **Fix PostToolUse hook crashes and 5-second latency (#1220)**: Added missing `break` statements to all 7 switch cases in `worker-service.ts` preventing fall-through execution, added `.catch()` on `main()` to handle unhandled promise rejections, and removed redundant `start` commands from hook groups that triggered the 5-second `collectStdin()` timeout
- **Fix CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT fallback for Stop hooks (#1215)**: Added POSIX shell-level `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` fallback in `hooks.json` for environments where the variable isn't injected, added script-level self-resolution via `import.meta.url` in `bun-runner.js`, and regression test added in `plugin-distribution.test.ts`

## Maintenance

- Synced all version files (plugin.json was stuck at 10.4.0)

## [10.4.2] - 2026-02-25

## Bug Fixes

- **Fix PostToolUse hook crashes and 5-second latency (#1220)**: Added missing `break` statements to all 7 switch cases in `worker-service.ts` preventing fall-through execution, added `.catch()` on `main()` to handle unhandled promise rejections, and removed redundant `start` commands from hook groups that triggered the 5-second `collectStdin()` timeout
- **Fix CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT fallback for Stop hooks (#1215)**: Added POSIX shell-level `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` fallback in `hooks.json` for environments where the variable isn't injected, added script-level self-resolution via `import.meta.url` in `bun-runner.js`, and regression test added in `plugin-distribution.test.ts`
- **Sync plugin.json version**: Fixed `plugin.json` being stuck at 10.4.0 while other version files were at 10.4.1

## [10.4.1] - 2026-02-24

### Refactor
- **Skills Conversion**: Converted `/make-plan` and `/do` commands into first-class skills in `plugin/skills/`.
- **Organization**: Centralized planning and execution instructions alongside `mem-search`.
- **Compatibility**: Added symlinks for `openclaw/skills/` to ensure seamless integration with OpenClaw.

### Chore
- **Version Bump**: Aligned all package and plugin manifests to v10.4.1.

## [10.4.0] - 2026-02-24

Massive reliability release: 30+ root-cause bug fixes across 10 triage phases, plus new features for agent attribution, Chroma control, and broader platform support.

### New Features

- 50+ new tests across hook lifecycle, context re-injection, plugin distribution, migration runner, data integrity, stale abort controller, logs tail-read, CORS, MCP type coercion, and smart-install
- 68 files changed, ~4200 insertions, ~900 deletions

## [10.3.3] - 2026-02-23

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed session context footer to reference the claude-mem skill instead of MCP search tools for accessing memories

## [10.3.2] - 2026-02-23

## Bug Fixes

- **Worker startup readiness**: Worker startup hook now waits for full DB/search readiness before proceeding, fixing the race condition where hooks would fire before the worker was initialized on first start (#1210)
- **MCP tool naming**: Renamed `save_memory` to `save_observation` for consistency with the observation-based data model (#1210)
- **MCP search instructions**: Updated MCP server tool descriptions to accurately reflect the 3-layer search workflow (#1210)
- **Installer hosting**: Serve installer JS from install.cmem.ai instead of GitHub raw URLs for reliability
- **Installer routing**: Added rewrite rule so install.cmem.ai root path correctly serves the install script
- **Installer build**: Added compiled installer dist so CLI installation works out of the box

## [10.3.1] - 2026-02-19

## Fix: Prevent Duplicate Worker Daemons and Zombie Processes

Three root causes of chroma-mcp timeouts identified and fixed:

### PID-based daemon guard
Exit immediately on startup if PID file points to a live process. Prevents the race condition where hooks firing simultaneously could start multiple daemons before either wrote a PID file.

### Port-based daemon guard
Exit if port 37777 is already bound — runs before WorkerService constructor registers keepalive signal handlers that previously prevented exit on EADDRINUSE.

### Guaranteed process.exit() after HTTP shutdown
HTTP shutdown (POST /api/admin/shutdown) now calls `process.exit(0)` in a `try/finally` block. Previously, zombie workers stayed alive after shutdown, and background tasks reconnected to chroma-mcp, spawning duplicate subprocesses contending for the same data directory.

## [10.3.0] - 2026-02-18

## Replace WASM Embeddings with Persistent chroma-mcp MCP Connection

### Highlights

- **New: ChromaMcpManager** — Singleton stdio MCP client communicating with chroma-mcp via `uvx`, replacing the previous ChromaServerManager (`npx chroma run` + `chromadb` npm + ONNX/WASM)
- **Eliminates native binary issues** — No more segfaults, WASM embedding failures, or cross-platform install headaches
- **Graceful subprocess lifecycle** — Wired into GracefulShutdown for clean teardown; zombie process prevention with kill-on-failure and stale `onclose` handler guards
- **Connection backoff** — 10-second reconnect backoff prevents chroma-mcp spawn storms
- **SQL injection guards** — Added parameterization to ChromaSync ID exclusion queries
- **Simplified ChromaSync** — Reduced complexity by delegating embedding concerns to chroma-mcp

### Breaking Changes

None — backward compatible. ChromaDB data is preserved; only the connection mechanism changed.

### Files Changed

- `src/services/sync/ChromaMcpManager.ts` (new) — MCP client singleton
- `src/services/sync/ChromaServerManager.ts` (deleted) — Old WASM/native approach
- `src/services/sync/ChromaSync.ts` — Simplified to use MCP client
- `src/services/worker-service.ts` — Updated startup sequence
- `src/services/infrastructure/GracefulShutdown.ts` — Subprocess cleanup integration

## [10.2.6] - 2026-02-18

## Bug Fixes

### Zombie Process Prevention (#1168, #1175)

Observer Claude CLI subprocesses were accumulating as zombies — processes that never exited after their session ended, causing massive resource leaks on long-running systems.

**Root cause:** When observer sessions ended (via idle timeout, abort, or error), the spawned Claude CLI subprocesses were not being reliably killed. The existing `ensureProcessExit()` in `SDKAgent` only covered the happy path; sessions terminated through `SessionRoutes` or `worker-service` bypassed process cleanup entirely.

**Fix — dual-layer approach:**

1. **Immediate cleanup:** Added `ensureProcessExit()` calls to the `finally` blocks in both `SessionRoutes.ts` and `worker-service.ts`, ensuring every session exit path kills its subprocess
2. **Periodic reaping:** Added `reapStaleSessions()` to `SessionManager` — a background interval that scans `~/.claude-mem/observer-sessions/` for stale PID files, verifies the process is still running, and kills any orphans with SIGKILL escalation

This ensures no observer subprocess survives beyond its session lifetime, even in crash scenarios.

## [10.2.5] - 2026-02-18

### Bug Fixes

- **Self-healing message queue**: Renamed `claimAndDelete` → `claimNextMessage` with atomic self-healing — automatically resets stale processing messages (>60s) back to pending before claiming, eliminating stuck messages from generator crashes without external timers
- **Removed redundant idle-timeout reset**: The `resetStaleProcessingMessages()` call during idle timeout in worker-service was removed (startup reset kept), since the atomic self-healing in `claimNextMessage` now handles recovery inline
- **TypeScript diagnostic fix**: Added `QUEUE` to logger `Component` type

### Tests

- 5 new tests for self-healing behavior (stuck recovery, active protection, atomicity, empty queue, session isolation)
- 1 new integration test for stuck recovery in zombie-prevention suite
- All existing queue tests updated for renamed method

## [10.2.4] - 2026-02-18

## Chroma Vector DB Backfill Fix

Fixes the Chroma backfill system to correctly sync all SQLite observations into the vector database on worker startup.

### Bug Fixes

- **Backfill all projects on startup** — `backfillAllProjects()` now runs on worker startup, iterating all projects in SQLite and syncing missing observations to Chroma. Previously `ensureBackfilled()` existed but was never called, leaving Chroma with incomplete data after cache clears.

- **Fixed critical collection routing bug** — Backfill now uses the shared `cm__claude-mem` collection (matching how DatabaseManager and SearchManager operate) instead of creating per-project orphan collections that no search path reads from.

- **Hardened collection name sanitization** — Project names with special characters (e.g., "YC Stuff") are sanitized for Chroma's naming constraints, including stripping trailing non-alphanumeric characters.

- **Eliminated shared mutable state** — `ensureBackfilled()` and `getExistingChromaIds()` now accept project as a parameter instead of mutating instance state, keeping a single Chroma connection while avoiding fragile property mutation across iterations.

- **Chroma readiness guard** — Backfill waits for Chroma server readiness before running, preventing spurious error logs when Chroma fails to start.

### Changed Files

- `src/services/sync/ChromaSync.ts` — Core backfill logic, sanitization, parameter passing
- `src/services/worker-service.ts` — Startup backfill trigger + readiness guard
- `src/utils/logger.ts` — Added `CHROMA_SYNC` log component

## [10.2.3] - 2026-02-17

## Fix Chroma ONNX Model Cache Corruption

Addresses the persistent embedding pipeline failures reported across #1104, #1105, #1110, and subsequent sessions. Three root causes identified and fixed:

### Changes

- **Removed nuclear `bun pm cache rm`** from both `smart-install.js` and `sync-marketplace.cjs`. This was added in v10.2.2 for the now-removed sharp dependency but destroyed all cached packages, breaking the ONNX resolution chain.
- **Added `bun install` in plugin cache directory** after marketplace sync. The cache directory had a `package.json` with `@chroma-core/default-embed` as a dependency but never ran install, so the worker couldn't resolve it at runtime.
- **Moved HuggingFace model cache to `~/.claude-mem/models/`** outside `node_modules`. The ~23MB ONNX model was stored inside `node_modules/@huggingface/transformers/.cache/`, so any reinstall or cache clear corrupted it.
- **Added self-healing retry** for Protobuf parsing failures. If the downloaded model is corrupted, the cache is cleared and re-downloaded automatically on next use.

### Files Changed

- `scripts/smart-install.js` — removed `bun pm cache rm`
- `scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs` — removed `bun pm cache rm`, added `bun install` in cache dir
- `src/services/sync/ChromaSync.ts` — moved model cache, added corruption recovery

## [10.2.2] - 2026-02-17

## Bug Fixes

- **Removed `node-addon-api` dev dependency** — was only needed for `sharp`, which was already removed in v10.2.1
- **Simplified native module cache clearing** in `smart-install.js` and `sync-marketplace.cjs` — replaced targeted `@img/sharp` directory deletion and lockfile removal with `bun pm cache rm`
- Reduced ~30 lines of brittle file system manipulation to a clean Bun CLI command

## [10.2.1] - 2026-02-16

## Bug Fixes

- **Bun install & sharp native modules**: Fixed stale native module cache issues on Bun updates, added `node-addon-api` as a dev dependency required by sharp (#1140)
- **PendingMessageStore consolidation**: Deduplicated PendingMessageStore initialization in worker-service; added session-scoped filtering to `resetStaleProcessingMessages` to prevent cross-session message resets (#1140)
- **Gemini empty response handling**: Fixed silent message deletion when Gemini returns empty summary responses — now logs a warning and preserves the original message (#1138)
- **Idle timeout session scoping**: Fixed idle timeout handler to only reset messages for the timed-out session instead of globally resetting all sessions (#1138)
- **Shell injection in sync-marketplace**: Replaced `execSync` with `spawnSync` for rsync calls to eliminate command injection via gitignore patterns (#1138)
- **Sharp cache invalidation**: Added cache clearing for sharp's native bindings when Bun version changes (#1138)
- **Marketplace install**: Switched marketplace sync from npm to bun for package installation consistency (#1140)

## [10.1.0] - 2026-02-16

## SessionStart System Message & Cleaner Defaults

### New Features

- **SessionStart `systemMessage` support** — Hooks can now display user-visible ANSI-colored messages directly in the CLI via a new `systemMessage` field on `HookResult`. The SessionStart hook uses this to render a colored timeline summary (separate from the markdown context injected for Claude), giving users an at-a-glance view of recent activity every time they start a session.

- **"View Observations Live" link** — Each session start now appends a clickable `http://localhost:{port}` URL so users can jump straight to the live observation viewer.

### Performance

- **Truly parallel context fetching** — The SessionStart handler now uses `Promise.all` to fetch both the markdown context (for Claude) and the ANSI-colored timeline (for user display) simultaneously, eliminating the serial fetch overhead.

### Defaults Changes

- **Cleaner out-of-box experience** — New installs now default to a streamlined context display:
  - Read tokens column: hidden (`CLAUDE_MEM_CONTEXT_SHOW_READ_TOKENS: false`)
  - Work tokens column: hidden (`CLAUDE_MEM_CONTEXT_SHOW_WORK_TOKENS: false`)
  - Savings amount: hidden (`CLAUDE_MEM_CONTEXT_SHOW_SAVINGS_AMOUNT: false`)
  - Full observation expansion: disabled (`CLAUDE_MEM_CONTEXT_FULL_COUNT: 0`)
  - Savings percentage remains visible by default

  Existing users are unaffected — your `~/.claude-mem/settings.json` overrides these defaults.

### Technical Details

- Added `systemMessage?: string` to `HookResult` interface (`src/cli/types.ts`)
- Claude Code adapter now forwards `systemMessage` in hook output (`src/cli/adapters/claude-code.ts`)
- Context handler refactored for parallel fetch with graceful fallback (`src/cli/handlers/context.ts`)
- Default settings tuned in `SettingsDefaultsManager` (`src/shared/SettingsDefaultsManager.ts`)

## [10.0.8] - 2026-02-16

## Bug Fixes

### Orphaned Subprocess Cleanup
- Add explicit subprocess cleanup after SDK query loop using existing `ProcessRegistry` infrastructure (`getProcessBySession` + `ensureProcessExit`), preventing orphaned Claude subprocesses from accumulating
- Closes #1010, #1089, #1090, #1068

### Chroma Binary Resolution
- Replace `npx chroma run` with absolute binary path resolution via `require.resolve`, falling back to `npx` with explicit `cwd` when the binary isn't found directly
- Closes #1120

### Cross-Platform Embedding Fix
- Remove `@chroma-core/default-embed` which pulled in `onnxruntime` + `sharp` native binaries that fail on many platforms
- Use WASM backend for Chroma embeddings, eliminating native binary compilation issues
- Closes #1104, #1105, #1110

## [10.0.7] - 2026-02-14

## Chroma HTTP Server Architecture

- **Persistent HTTP server**: Switched from in-process Chroma to a persistent HTTP server managed by the new `ChromaServerManager` for better reliability and performance
- **Local embeddings**: Added `DefaultEmbeddingFunction` for local vector embeddings — no external API required
- **Pinned chromadb v3.2.2**: Fixed compatibility with v2 API heartbeat endpoint
- **Server lifecycle improvements**: Addressed PR review feedback for proper start/stop/health check handling

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed SDK spawn failures and sharp native binary crashes
- Added `plugin.json` to root `.claude-plugin` directory for proper plugin structure
- Removed duplicate else block from merge artifact

## Infrastructure

- Added multi-tenancy support for claude-mem Pro
- Updated OpenClaw install URLs to `install.cmem.ai`
- Added Vercel deploy workflow for install scripts
- Added `.claude/plans` and `.claude/worktrees` to `.gitignore`

## [10.0.6] - 2026-02-13

## Bug Fixes

- **OpenClaw: Fix MEMORY.md project query mismatch** — `syncMemoryToWorkspace` now includes both the base project name and the agent-scoped project name (e.g., both "openclaw" and "openclaw-main") when querying for context injection, ensuring the correct observations are pulled into MEMORY.md.

- **OpenClaw: Add feed botToken support for Telegram** — Feeds can now configure a dedicated `botToken` for direct Telegram message delivery, bypassing the OpenClaw gateway channel. This fixes scenarios where the gateway bot token couldn't be used for feed messages.

## Other

- Changed OpenClaw plugin kind from "integration" to "memory" for accuracy.

## [10.0.5] - 2026-02-13

## OpenClaw Installer & Distribution

- Fix: detect both `openclaw` and `openclaw.mjs` binary names in gateway discovery
- Fix: pass file paths via env vars instead of bash interpolation in `node -e` calls
- Fix: handle stale plugin config that blocks OpenClaw CLI during reinstall
- Fix: remove stale memory slot reference during reinstall cleanup
- Fix: remove opinionated filters from OpenClaw plugin

## [10.0.4] - 2026-02-12

## Revert: v10.0.3 chroma-mcp spawn storm fix

v10.0.3 introduced regressions. This release reverts the codebase to the stable v10.0.2 state.

### What was reverted

- Connection mutex via promise memoization
- Pre-spawn process count guard
- Hardened `close()` with try-finally + Unix `pkill -P` fallback
- Count-based orphan reaper in `ProcessManager`
- Circuit breaker (3 failures → 60s cooldown)
- `etime`-based sorting for process guards

### Files restored to v10.0.2

- `src/services/sync/ChromaSync.ts`
- `src/services/infrastructure/GracefulShutdown.ts`
- `src/services/infrastructure/ProcessManager.ts`
- `src/services/worker-service.ts`
- `src/services/worker/ProcessRegistry.ts`
- `tests/infrastructure/process-manager.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/chroma-vector-sync.test.ts`

## [10.0.3] - 2026-02-11

## Fix: Prevent chroma-mcp spawn storm (PR #1065)

Fixes a critical bug where killing the worker daemon during active sessions caused **641 chroma-mcp Python processes** to spawn in ~5 minutes, consuming 75%+ CPU and ~64GB virtual memory.

### Root Cause

`ChromaSync.ensureConnection()` had no connection mutex. Concurrent fire-and-forget `syncObservation()` calls from multiple sessions raced through the check-then-act guard, each spawning a chroma-mcp subprocess via `StdioClientTransport`. Error-driven reconnection created a positive feedback loop.

### 5-Layer Defense

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **0** | Connection mutex via promise memoization | Coalesces concurrent callers onto a single spawn attempt |
| **1** | Pre-spawn process count guard (`execFileSync('ps')`) | Kills excess chroma-mcp processes before spawning new ones |
| **2** | Hardened `close()` with try-finally + Unix `pkill -P` fallback | Guarantees state reset even on error, kills orphaned children |
| **3** | Count-based orphan reaper in `ProcessManager` | Kills by count (not age), catches spawn storms where all processes are young |
| **4** | Circuit breaker (3 failures → 60s cooldown) | Stops error-driven reconnection positive feedback loop |

### Additional Fix

- Process guards now use `etime`-based sorting instead of PID ordering for reliable age determination (PIDs wrap and don't guarantee ordering)

### Testing

- 16 new tests for mutex, circuit breaker, close() hardening, and count guard
- All tests pass (947 pass, 3 skip)

Closes #1063, closes #695. Relates to #1010, #707.

## [10.0.2] - 2026-02-11

## Bug Fixes

- **Prevent daemon silent death from SIGHUP + unhandled errors** — Worker process could silently die when receiving SIGHUP signals or encountering unhandled errors, leaving hooks without a backend. Now properly handles these signals and prevents silent crashes.
- **Hook resilience and worker lifecycle improvements** — Comprehensive fixes for hook command error classification, addressing issues #957, #923, #984, #987, and #1042. Hooks now correctly distinguish between worker unavailability errors and other failures.
- **Clarify TypeError order dependency in error classifier** — Fixed error classification logic to properly handle TypeError ordering edge cases.

## New Features

- **Project-scoped statusline counter utility** — Added `statusline-counts.js` for tracking observation counts per project in the Claude Code status line.

## Internal

- Added test coverage for hook command error classification and process manager
- Worker service and MCP server lifecycle improvements
- Process manager enhancements for better cross-platform stability

### Contributors
- @rodboev — Hook resilience and worker lifecycle fixes (PR #1056)

### Build Artifacts
- Rebuilt worker service and MCP server with latest changes

## [10.0.0] - 2026-02-11

## OpenClaw Plugin — Persistent Memory for OpenClaw Agents

Claude-mem now has an official [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) plugin, bringing persistent memory to agents running on the OpenClaw gateway. This is a major milestone — claude-mem's memory system is no longer limited to Claude Code sessions.

### What It Does

The plugin bridges claude-mem's observation pipeline with OpenClaw's embedded runner (`pi-embedded`), which calls the Anthropic API directly without spawning a `claude` process. Three core capabilities:

1. **Observation Recording** — Captures every tool call from OpenClaw agents and sends it to the claude-mem worker for AI-powered compression and storage
2. **MEMORY.md Live Sync** — Writes a continuously-updated memory timeline to each agent's workspace, so agents start every session with full context from previous work
3. **Observation Feed** — Streams new observations to messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp, LINE) in real-time via SSE

### Quick Start

Add claude-mem to your OpenClaw gateway config:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "claude-mem": {
      "enabled": true,
      "config": {
        "project": "my-project",
        "syncMemoryFile": true,
        "observationFeed": {
          "enabled": true,
          "channel": "telegram",
          "to": "your-chat-id"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The claude-mem worker service must be running on the same machine (`localhost:37777`).

### Commands

- `/claude-mem-status` — Worker health check, active sessions, feed connection state
- `/claude-mem-feed` — Show/toggle observation feed status
- `/claude-mem-feed on|off` — Enable/disable feed

### How the Event Lifecycle Works

```
OpenClaw Gateway
  ├── session_start ──────────→ Init claude-mem session
  ├── before_agent_start ─────→ Sync MEMORY.md + track workspace
  ├── tool_result_persist ────→ Record observation + re-sync MEMORY.md
  ├── agent_end ──────────────→ Summarize + complete session
  ├── session_end ────────────→ Clean up session tracking
  └── gateway_start ──────────→ Reset all tracking
```

All observation recording and MEMORY.md syncs are fire-and-forget — they never block the agent.

## Windows Platform Improvements

- **ProcessManager**: Migrated daemon spawning from deprecated WMIC to PowerShell `Start-Process` with `-WindowStyle Hidden`
- **ChromaSync**: Re-enabled vector search on Windows (was previously disabled entirely)
- **Worker Service**: Added unified DB-ready gate middleware — all DB-dependent endpoints now wait for initialization instead of returning "Database not initialized" errors
- **EnvManager**: Switched from fragile allowlist to simple blocklist for subprocess env vars (only strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` per Issue #733)

## Session Management Fixes

- Fixed unbounded session tracking map growth — maps are now cleaned up on `session_end`
- Session init moved to `session_start` and `after_compaction` hooks for correct lifecycle handling

## SSE Fixes

- Fixed stream URL consistency across the codebase
- Fixed multi-line SSE data frame parsing (concatenates `data:` lines per SSE spec)

## Issue Triage

Closed 37+ duplicate/stale/invalid issues across multiple triage phases, significantly cleaning up the issue tracker.

## [9.1.1] - 2026-02-07

## Critical Bug Fix: Worker Initialization Failure

**v9.1.0 was unable to initialize its database on existing installations.** This patch fixes the root cause and several related issues.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix FOREIGN KEY constraint failure during migration** — The `addOnUpdateCascadeToForeignKeys` migration (schema v21) crashed when orphaned observations existed (observations whose `memory_session_id` has no matching row in `sdk_sessions`). Fixed by disabling FK checks (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF`) during table recreation, following SQLite's recommended migration pattern.

- **Remove hardcoded CHECK constraints on observation type column** — Multiple locations enforced `CHECK(type IN ('decision', 'bugfix', ...))` but the mode system (v8.0.0+) allows custom observation types, causing constraint violations. Removed all 5 occurrences across `SessionStore.ts`, `migrations.ts`, and `migrations/runner.ts`.

- **Fix Express middleware ordering for initialization guard** — The `/api/*` guard middleware that waits for DB initialization was registered AFTER routes, so Express matched routes before the guard. Moved guard middleware registration BEFORE route registrations. Added dedicated early handler for `/api/context/inject` to fail-open during init.

### New

- **Restored mem-search skill** — Recreated `plugin/skills/mem-search/SKILL.md` with the 3-layer workflow (search → timeline → batch fetch) updated for the current MCP tool set.

## [9.1.0] - 2026-02-07

- **Stateless provider IDs** — Synthetic memorySessionId generation for Gemini/OpenRouter (concept from PR #615 by @JiehoonKwak)
- **Duplicate generator prevention** — Legacy init endpoint uses idempotent \`ensureGeneratorRunning()\` (PR #932 by @jayvenn21)
- **DB readiness wait** — Session-init endpoint waits for database initialization (PR #828 by @rajivsinclair)
- **Image-only prompt support** — Empty/media prompts use \`[media prompt]\` placeholder (concept from PR #928 by @iammike)

## [9.0.17] - 2026-02-05

## Bug Fixes

### Fix Fresh Install Bun PATH Resolution (#818)

On fresh installations, hooks would fail because Bun wasn't in PATH until terminal restart. The `smart-install.js` script installs Bun to `~/.bun/bin/bun`, but the current shell session doesn't have it in PATH.

**Fix:** Introduced `bun-runner.js` — a Node.js wrapper that searches common Bun installation locations across all platforms:
- PATH (via `which`/`where`)
- `~/.bun/bin/bun` (default install location)
- `/usr/local/bin/bun`
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/bun` (macOS Homebrew)
- `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/bun` (Linuxbrew)
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bun` or fallback paths

All 9 hook definitions updated to use `node bun-runner.js` instead of direct `bun` calls.

**Files changed:**
- `plugin/scripts/bun-runner.js` — New 88-line Bun discovery script
- `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` — All hook commands now route through bun-runner

## [9.0.16] - 2026-02-05

## Bug Fixes

### Fix Worker Startup Timeout (#811, #772, #729)

Resolves the "Worker did not become ready within 15 seconds" timeout error that could prevent hooks from communicating with the worker service.

**Root cause:** `isWorkerHealthy()` and `waitForHealth()` were checking `/api/readiness`, which returns 503 until full initialization completes — including MCP connection setup that can take 5+ minutes. Hooks only have a 15-second timeout window.

**Fix:** Switched to `/api/health` (liveness check), which returns 200 as soon as the HTTP server is listening. This is sufficient for hook communication since the worker accepts requests while background initialization continues.

**Files changed:**
- `src/shared/worker-utils.ts` — `isWorkerHealthy()` now checks `/api/health`
- `src/services/infrastructure/HealthMonitor.ts` — `waitForHealth()` now checks `/api/health`
- `tests/infrastructure/health-monitor.test.ts` — Updated test expectations

### PR Merge Tasks
- PR #820 merged with full verification pipeline (rebase, code review, build verification, test, manual verification)

## [9.0.15] - 2026-02-05

## Security Fix

### Isolated Credentials (#745)
- **Prevents API key hijacking** from random project `.env` files
- Credentials now sourced exclusively from `~/.claude-mem/.env`
- Only whitelisted environment variables passed to SDK `query()` calls
- Authentication method logging shows whether using Claude Code CLI subscription billing or explicit API key

This is a security-focused patch release that hardens credential handling to prevent unintended API key usage from project directories.

## [9.0.14] - 2026-02-05

## In-Process Worker Architecture

This release includes the merged in-process worker architecture from PR #722, which fundamentally improves how hooks interact with the worker service.

### Changes

- **In-process worker architecture** - Hook processes now become the worker when port 37777 is available, eliminating Windows spawn issues
- **Hook command improvements** - Added `skipExit` option to `hook-command.ts` for chained command execution
- **Worker health checks** - `worker-utils.ts` now returns boolean status for cleaner health monitoring
- **Massive CLAUDE.md cleanup** - Removed 76 redundant documentation files (4,493 lines removed)
- **Chained hook configuration** - `hooks.json` now supports chained commands for complex workflows

### Technical Details

The in-process architecture means hooks no longer need to spawn separate worker processes. When port 37777 is available, the hook itself becomes the worker, providing:
- Faster startup times
- Better resource utilization
- Elimination of process spawn failures on Windows

## [9.0.13] - 2026-02-05

## Bug Fixes

### Zombie Observer Prevention (#856)

Fixed a critical issue where observer processes could become "zombies" - lingering indefinitely without activity. This release adds:

- **3-minute idle timeout**: SessionQueueProcessor now automatically terminates after 3 minutes of inactivity
- **Race condition fix**: Resolved spurious wakeup issues by resetting `lastActivityTime` on queue activity
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Added 11 new tests for the idle timeout mechanism

This fix prevents resource leaks from orphaned observer processes that could accumulate over time.

## [9.0.12] - 2026-01-28

## Fix: Authentication failure from observer session isolation

**Critical bugfix** for users who upgraded to v9.0.11.

### Problem

v9.0.11 introduced observer session isolation using `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` override, which inadvertently broke authentication:

```
Invalid API key · Please run /login
```

This happened because Claude Code stores credentials in the config directory, and overriding it prevented access to existing auth tokens.

### Solution

Observer sessions now use the SDK's `cwd` option instead:
- Sessions stored under `~/.claude-mem/observer-sessions/` project
- Auth credentials in `~/.claude/` remain accessible
- Observer sessions still won't pollute `claude --resume` lists

### Affected Users

Anyone running v9.0.11 who saw "Invalid API key" errors should upgrade immediately.

## [9.0.11] - 2026-01-28

## Bug Fixes

### Observer Session Isolation (#837)
Observer sessions created by claude-mem were polluting the `claude --resume` list, cluttering it with internal plugin sessions that users never intend to resume. In one user's case, 74 observer sessions out of ~220 total (34% noise).

**Solution**: Observer processes now use a dedicated config directory (`~/.claude-mem/observer-config/`) to isolate their session files from user sessions.

Thanks to @Glucksberg for this fix! Fixes #832.

### Stale memory_session_id Crash Prevention (#839)
After a worker restart, stale `memory_session_id` values in the database could cause crashes when attempting to resume SDK conversations. The existing guard didn't protect against this because session data was loaded from the database.

**Solution**: Clear `memory_session_id` when loading sessions from the database (not from cache). The key insight: if a session isn't in memory, any database `memory_session_id` is definitely stale.

Thanks to @bigph00t for this fix! Fixes #817.

## [9.0.10] - 2026-01-26

## Bug Fix

**Fixed path format mismatch causing folder CLAUDE.md files to show "No recent activity" (#794)** - Thanks @bigph00t!

The folder-level CLAUDE.md generation was failing to find observations due to a path format mismatch between how API queries used absolute paths and how the database stored relative paths. The `isDirectChild()` function's simple prefix match always returned false in these cases.

**Root cause:** PR #809 (v9.0.9) only masked this bug by skipping file creation when "no activity" was detected. Since ALL folders were affected, this prevented file creation entirely. This PR provides the actual fix.

**Changes:**
- Added new shared module `src/shared/path-utils.ts` with robust path normalization and matching utilities
- Updated `SessionSearch.ts`, `regenerate-claude-md.ts`, and `claude-md-utils.ts` to use shared path utilities
- Added comprehensive test coverage (61 new tests) for path matching edge cases

## [9.0.9] - 2026-01-26

## Bug Fixes

### Prevent Creation of Empty CLAUDE.md Files (#809)

Previously, claude-mem would create new `CLAUDE.md` files in project directories even when there was no activity to display, cluttering codebases with empty context files showing only "*No recent activity*".

**What changed:** The `updateFolderClaudeMdFiles` function now checks if the formatted content contains no activity before writing. If a `CLAUDE.md` file doesn't already exist and there's nothing to show, it will be skipped entirely. Existing files will still be updated to reflect "No recent activity" if that's the current state.

**Impact:** Cleaner project directories - only folders with actual activity will have `CLAUDE.md` context files created.

Thanks to @maxmillienjr for this contribution!

## [9.0.8] - 2026-01-26

## Fix: Prevent Zombie Process Accumulation (Issue #737)

This release fixes a critical issue where Claude haiku subprocesses spawned by the SDK weren't terminating properly, causing zombie process accumulation. One user reported 155 processes consuming 51GB RAM.

### Root Causes Addressed
- SDK's SpawnedProcess interface hides subprocess PIDs
- `deleteSession()` didn't verify subprocess exit
- `abort()` was fire-and-forget with no confirmation
- No mechanism to track or clean up orphaned processes

### Solution
- **ProcessRegistry module**: Tracks spawned Claude subprocesses via PID
- **Custom spawn**: Uses SDK's `spawnClaudeCodeProcess` option to capture PIDs
- **Signal propagation**: Passes signal parameter to enable AbortController integration
- **Graceful shutdown**: Waits for subprocess exit in `deleteSession()` with 5s timeout
- **SIGKILL escalation**: Force-kills processes that don't exit gracefully
- **Orphan reaper**: Safety net running every 5 minutes to clean up any missed processes
- **Race detection**: Warns about multiple processes per session (race condition indicator)

### Files Changed
- `src/services/worker/ProcessRegistry.ts` (new): PID registry and reaper
- `src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts`: Use custom spawn to capture PIDs
- `src/services/worker/SessionManager.ts`: Verify subprocess exit on delete
- `src/services/worker-service.ts`: Start/stop orphan reaper

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v9.0.7...v9.0.8

Fixes #737

## [9.0.6] - 2026-01-22

## Windows Console Popup Fix

This release eliminates the annoying console window popups that Windows users experienced when claude-mem spawned background processes.

### Fixed
- **Windows console popups eliminated** - Daemon spawn and Chroma operations no longer create visible console windows (#748, #708, #681, #676)
- **Race condition in PID file writing** - Worker now writes its own PID file after listen() succeeds, ensuring reliable process tracking on all platforms

### Changed
- **Chroma temporarily disabled on Windows** - Vector search is disabled on Windows while we migrate to a popup-free architecture. Keyword search and all other memory features continue to work. A follow-up release will re-enable Chroma.
- **Slash command discoverability** - Added YAML frontmatter to `/do` and `/make-plan` commands

### Technical Details
- Uses WMIC for detached process spawning on Windows
- PID file location unchanged, but now written by worker process
- Cross-platform: Linux/macOS behavior unchanged

### Contributors
- @bigph00t (Alexander Knigge)

## [9.0.5] - 2026-01-14

## Major Worker Service Cleanup

This release contains a significant refactoring of `worker-service.ts`, removing ~216 lines of dead code and simplifying the architecture.

### Refactoring
- **Removed dead code**: Deleted `runInteractiveSetup` function (defined but never called)
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed unused imports (fs namespace, spawn, homedir, readline, existsSync, writeFileSync, readFileSync, mkdirSync)
- **Removed fallback agent concept**: Users who choose Gemini/OpenRouter now get those providers directly without hidden fallback behavior
- **Eliminated re-export indirection**: ResponseProcessor now imports directly from CursorHooksInstaller instead of through worker-service

### Security Fix
- **Removed dangerous ANTHROPIC_API_KEY check**: Claude Code uses CLI authentication, not direct API calls. The previous check could accidentally use a user's API key (from other projects) which costs 20x more than Claude Code's pricing

### Build Improvements
- **Dynamic MCP version management**: MCP server and client versions now use build-time injected values from package.json instead of hardcoded strings, ensuring version synchronization

### Documentation
- Added Anti-Pattern Czar Generalization Analysis report
- Updated README with $CMEM links and contract address
- Added comprehensive cleanup and validation plans for worker-service.ts

## [9.0.4] - 2026-01-10

## What's New

## [9.0.3] - 2026-01-10

## Bug Fixes

### Hook Framework JSON Status Output (#655)

Fixed an issue where the worker service startup wasn't producing proper JSON status output for the Claude Code hook framework. This caused hooks to appear stuck or unresponsive during worker initialization.

**Changes:**
- Added `buildStatusOutput()` function for generating structured JSON status output
- Worker now outputs JSON with `status`, `message`, and `continue` fields on stdout
- Proper exit code 0 ensures Windows Terminal compatibility (no tab accumulation)
- `continue: true` flag ensures Claude Code continues processing after hook execution

**Technical Details:**
- Extracted status output generation into a pure, testable function
- Added comprehensive test coverage in `tests/infrastructure/worker-json-status.test.ts`
- 23 passing tests covering unit, CLI integration, and hook framework compatibility

## Housekeeping

- Removed obsolete error handling baseline file

## [9.0.2] - 2026-01-10

## Bug Fixes

- **Windows Terminal Tab Accumulation (#625, #628)**: Fixed terminal tab accumulation on Windows by implementing graceful exit strategy. All expected failure scenarios (port conflicts, version mismatches, health check timeouts) now exit with code 0 instead of code 1.
- **Windows 11 Compatibility (#625)**: Replaced deprecated WMIC commands with PowerShell `Get-Process` and `Get-CimInstance` for process enumeration. WMIC is being removed from Windows 11.

## Maintenance

- **Removed Obsolete CLAUDE.md Files**: Cleaned up auto-generated CLAUDE.md files from `~/.claude/plans/` and `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` directories.

- Context is now injected silently via SessionStart hook
- Removed deprecated `user-message-hook` (no longer used in CC 2.1.0+)

### Path Validation for CLAUDE.md Distribution
- Added `isValidPathForClaudeMd()` to reject malformed paths:
  - Tilde paths (`~`) that Node.js doesn't expand
  - URLs (`http://`, `https://`)
  - Paths with spaces (likely command text or PR references)
  - Paths with `#` (GitHub issue/PR references)
  - Relative paths that escape project boundary
- Cleaned up 12 invalid CLAUDE.md files created by bug artifacts
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future accidents

### Log-Level Audit
- Promoted 38+ WARN messages to ERROR level for improved debugging:
  - Parser: observation type errors, data contamination
  - SDK/Agents: empty init responses (Gemini, OpenRouter)
  - Worker/Queue: session recovery, auto-recovery failures
  - Chroma: sync failures, search failures
  - SQLite: search failures
  - Session/Generator: failures, missing context
  - Infrastructure: shutdown, process management failures

## [8.5.6] - 2026-01-04

## Major Architectural Refactoring

Decomposes monolithic services into modular, maintainable components:

### Worker Service
Extracted infrastructure (GracefulShutdown, HealthMonitor, ProcessManager), server layer (ErrorHandler, Middleware, Server), and integrations (CursorHooksInstaller)

### Context Generator
Split into ContextBuilder, ContextConfigLoader, ObservationCompiler, TokenCalculator, formatters (Color/Markdown), and section renderers (Header/Footer/Summary/Timeline)

### Search System
Extracted SearchOrchestrator, ResultFormatter, TimelineBuilder, and strategy pattern (Chroma/SQLite/Hybrid search strategies) with dedicated filters (Date/Project/Type)

### Agent System
Extracted shared logic into ResponseProcessor, ObservationBroadcaster, FallbackErrorHandler, and SessionCleanupHelper

### SQLite Layer
Decomposed SessionStore into domain modules (observations, prompts, sessions, summaries, timeline) with proper type exports

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed duplicate observation storage bug (observations stored multiple times when messages were batched)
- Added duplicate observation cleanup script for production database remediation
- Fixed FOREIGN KEY constraint and missing `failed_at_epoch` column issues

## Coming Next
Comprehensive test suite in a new PR, targeting **v8.6.0**

## [8.5.5] - 2026-01-03

## Improved Error Handling and Logging

This patch release enhances error handling and logging across all worker services for better debugging and reliability.

### Changes
- **Enhanced Error Logging**: Improved error context across SessionStore, SearchManager, SDKAgent, GeminiAgent, and OpenRouterAgent
- **SearchManager**: Restored error handling for Chroma calls with improved logging
- **SessionStore**: Enhanced error logging throughout database operations
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed critical bug where `memory_session_id` could incorrectly equal `content_session_id`
- **Hooks**: Streamlined error handling and loading states for better maintainability

### Investigation Reports
- Added detailed analysis documents for generator failures and observation duplication regressions

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v8.5.4...v8.5.5

## [8.5.4] - 2026-01-02

## Bug Fixes

### Chroma Connection Error Handling
Fixed a critical bug in ChromaSync where connection-related errors were misinterpreted as missing collections. The `ensureCollection()` method previously caught ALL errors and assumed they meant the collection doesn't exist, which caused connection errors to trigger unnecessary collection creation attempts. Now connection-related errors like "Not connected" are properly distinguished and re-thrown immediately, preventing false error handling paths and inappropriate fallback behavior.

### Removed Dead last_user_message Code
Cleaned up dead code related to `last_user_message` handling in the summary flow. This field was being extracted from transcripts but never used anywhere - in Claude Code transcripts, "user" type messages are mostly tool_results rather than actual user input, and the user's original request is already stored in the user_prompts table. Removing this unused field eliminates confusing warnings like "Missing last_user_message when queueing summary". Changes span summary-hook, SessionRoutes, SessionManager, interface definitions, and all agent implementations.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling Across Services
Comprehensive improvement to error handling across 8 core services:
- **BranchManager** - Now logs recovery checkout failures
- **PaginationHelper** - Logs when file paths are plain strings instead of valid JSON
- **SDKAgent** - Enhanced logging for Claude executable detection failures
- **SearchManager** - Logs plain string handling for files read and edited
- **paths.ts** - Improved logging for git root detection failures
- **timeline-formatting** - Enhanced JSON parsing errors with input previews
- **transcript-parser** - Logs summary of parse errors after processing
- **ChromaSync** - Logs full error context before attempting collection creation

### Error Handling Documentation & Tooling
- Created `error-handling-baseline.txt` establishing baseline error handling practices
- Documented error handling anti-pattern rules in CLAUDE.md
- Added `detect-error-handling-antipatterns.ts` script to identify empty catch blocks, improper logging practices, and oversized try-catch blocks

## New Features

### Console Filter Bar with Log Parsing
Implemented interactive log filtering in the viewer UI:
- **Structured Log Parsing** - Extracts timestamp, level, component, correlation ID, and message content using regex pattern matching
- **Level Filtering** - Toggle visibility for DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR log levels
- **Component Filtering** - Filter by 9 component types: HOOK, WORKER, SDK, PARSER, DB, SYSTEM, HTTP, SESSION, CHROMA
- **Color-Coded Rendering** - Visual distinction with component-specific icons and log level colors
- **Special Message Detection** - Recognizes markers like → (dataIn), ← (dataOut), ✓ (success), ✗ (failure), ⏱ (timing), [HAPPY-PATH]
- **Smart Auto-Scroll** - Maintains scroll position when reviewing older logs
- **Responsive Design** - Filter bar adapts to smaller screens

## [8.5.3] - 2026-01-02

# 🛡️ Error Handling Hardening & Developer Tools

Version 8.5.3 introduces comprehensive error handling improvements that prevent silent failures and reduce debugging time from hours to minutes. This release also adds new developer tools for queue management and log monitoring.

---

## 🔴 Critical Error Handling Improvements

### The Problem
A single overly-broad try-catch block caused a **10-hour debugging session** by silently swallowing errors. This pattern was pervasive throughout the codebase, creating invisible failure modes.

### The Solution

**Automated Anti-Pattern Detection** (`scripts/detect-error-handling-antipatterns.ts`)
- Detects 7 categories of error handling anti-patterns
- Enforces zero-tolerance policy for empty catch blocks
- Identifies large try-catch blocks (>10 lines) that mask specific errors
- Flags missing error logging that causes silent failures
- Supports approved overrides with justification comments
- Exit code 1 if critical issues detected (enforceable in CI)

**New Error Handling Standards** (Added to `CLAUDE.md`)
- **5-Question Pre-Flight Checklist**: Required before writing any try-catch
  1. What SPECIFIC error am I catching?
  2. Show documentation proving this error can occur
  3. Why can't this error be prevented?
  4. What will the catch block DO?
  5. Why shouldn't this error propagate?
- **Forbidden Patterns**: Empty catch, catch without logging, large try blocks, promise catch without handlers
- **Allowed Patterns**: Specific errors, logged failures, minimal scope, explicit recovery
- **Meta-Rule**: Uncertainty triggers research, NOT try-catch

### Fixes Applied

**Wave 1: Empty Catch Blocks** (5 files)
- `import-xml-observations.ts` - Log skipped invalid JSON
- `bun-path.ts` - Log when bun not in PATH
- `cursor-utils.ts` - Log failed registry reads & corrupt MCP config
- `worker-utils.ts` - Log failed health checks

**Wave 2: Promise Catches on Critical Paths** (8 locations)
- `worker-service.ts` - Background initialization failures
- `SDKAgent.ts` - Session processor errors (2 locations)
- `GeminiAgent.ts` - Finalization failures (2 locations)
- `OpenRouterAgent.ts` - Finalization failures (2 locations)
- `SessionManager.ts` - Generator promise failures

**Wave 3: Comprehensive Audit** (29 catch blocks)
- Added logging to 16 catch blocks (UI, servers, worker, routes, services)
- Documented 13 intentional exceptions with justification comments
- All patterns now follow error handling guidelines with appropriate log levels

### Approved Override System

For justified exceptions (performance-critical paths, expected failures), use:
```typescript
// [APPROVED OVERRIDE]: Brief technical justification
try {
  // code
} catch {
  // allowed exception
}
```

**Progress**: 163 anti-patterns → 26 approved overrides (84% reduction in silent failures)

---

## 🗂️ Queue Management Features

**New Commands**
- `npm run queue:clear` - Interactive removal of failed messages
- `npm run queue:clear -- --all` - Clear all messages (pending, processing, failed)
- `npm run queue:clear -- --force` - Non-interactive mode

**HTTP API Endpoints**
- `DELETE /api/pending-queue/failed` - Remove failed messages
- `DELETE /api/pending-queue/all` - Complete queue reset

Failed messages exceed max retry count and remain for debugging. These commands provide clean queue maintenance.

## 🪵 Developer Console (Chrome DevTools Style)

**UI Improvements**
- Bottom drawer console (slides up from bottom-left corner)
- Draggable resize handle for height adjustment
- Auto-refresh toggle (2s interval)
- Clear logs button with confirmation
- Monospace font (SF Mono/Monaco/Consolas)
- Minimum height: 150px, adjustable to window height - 100px

**API Endpoints**

## [8.5.2] - 2025-12-31

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed SDK Agent Memory Leak (#499)

Fixed a critical memory leak where Claude SDK child processes were never terminated after sessions completed. Over extended usage, this caused hundreds of orphaned processes consuming 40GB+ of RAM.

**Root Cause:**
- When the SDK agent generator completed naturally (no more messages to process), the `AbortController` was never aborted
- Child processes spawned by the Agent SDK remained running indefinitely
- Sessions stayed in memory (by design for future events) but underlying processes were never cleaned up

**Fix:**
- Added proper cleanup to SessionRoutes finally block
- Now calls `abortController.abort()` when generator completes with no pending work
- Creates new `AbortController` when crash recovery restarts generators
- Ensures cleanup happens even if recovery logic fails

**Impact:**
- Prevents orphaned `claude` processes from accumulating
- Eliminates multi-gigabyte memory leaks during normal usage
- Maintains crash recovery functionality with proper resource cleanup

Thanks to @yonnock for the detailed bug report and investigation in #499!

## [8.5.1] - 2025-12-30

## Bug Fix

**Fixed**: Migration 17 column rename failing for databases in intermediate states (#481)

### Problem
Migration 17 renamed session ID columns but used a single check to determine if ALL tables were migrated. This caused errors for databases in partial migration states:
- `no such column: sdk_session_id` (when columns already renamed)
- `table observations has no column named memory_session_id` (when not renamed)

### Solution
- Rewrote migration 17 to check **each table individually** before renaming
- Added `safeRenameColumn()` helper that handles all edge cases gracefully
- Handles all database states: fresh, old, and partially migrated

### Who was affected
- Users upgrading from pre-v8.2.6 versions
- Users whose migration was interrupted (crash, restart, etc.)
- Users who restored database from backup

## [8.5.0] - 2025-12-30

# Cursor Support Now Available 🎉

This is a major release introducing **full Cursor IDE support**. Claude-mem now works with Cursor, bringing persistent AI memory to Cursor users with or without a Claude Code subscription.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v8.2.10...v8.5.0

## [8.2.10] - 2025-12-30

## Bug Fixes

- **Auto-restart worker on version mismatch** (#484): When the plugin updates but the worker was already running on the old version, the worker now automatically restarts instead of failing with 400 errors.

### Changes
- `/api/version` endpoint now returns the built-in version (compiled at build time) instead of reading from disk
- `worker-service start` command checks for version mismatch and auto-restarts if needed
- Downgraded hook version mismatch warning to debug logging (now handled by auto-restart)

Thanks @yungweng for the detailed bug report!

## [8.2.9] - 2025-12-29

## Bug Fixes

- **Worker Service**: Remove file-based locking and improve Windows stability

  - Removed AbortSignal.timeout() calls to reduce Bun libuv assertion errors on Windows
  - Added 500ms shutdown delays on Windows to prevent zombie ports
  - Reduced hook timeout values for improved responsiveness
  - Increased worker readiness polling duration from 5s to 15s

## Internal Changes

- Updated worker CLI scripts to reference worker-service.cjs directly
- Simplified hook command configurations

## [8.2.8] - 2025-12-29

## Bug Fixes

## [8.2.1] - 2025-12-27

## 🔧 Worker Lifecycle Hardening

This patch release addresses critical bugs discovered during PR review of the self-spawn pattern introduced in 8.2.0. The worker daemon now handles edge cases robustly across both Unix and Windows platforms.

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### Process Exit Detection Fixed
The `waitForProcessesExit` function was crashing when processes exited during monitoring. The `process.kill(pid, 0)` call throws when a process no longer exists, which was not being caught. Now wrapped in try/catch to correctly identify exited processes.

#### Spawn PID Validation
The worker daemon now validates that `spawn()` actually returned a valid PID before writing to the PID file. Previously, spawn failures could leave invalid PID files that broke subsequent lifecycle operations.

#### Cross-Platform Orphan Cleanup
- **Unix**: Replaced single `kill` command with individual `process.kill()` calls wrapped in try/catch, so one already-exited process doesn't abort cleanup of remaining orphans
- **Windows**: Wrapped `taskkill` calls in try/catch for the same reason

#### Health Check Reliability
Changed `waitForHealth` to use the `/api/readiness` endpoint (returns 503 until fully initialized) instead of just checking if the port is in use. Callers now wait for *actual* worker readiness, not just network availability.

### 🔄 Refactoring

#### Code Consolidation (-580 lines)
Deleted obsolete process management infrastructure that was replaced by the self-spawn pattern:
- `src/services/process/ProcessManager.ts` (433 lines) - PID management now in worker-service
- `src/cli/worker-cli.ts` (81 lines) - CLI handling now in worker-service
- `src/services/worker-wrapper.ts` (157 lines) - Replaced by `--daemon` flag

#### Updated Hook Commands
All hooks now use `worker-service.cjs` CLI directly instead of the deleted `worker-cli.js`.

### ⏱️ Timeout Adjustments

Increased timeouts throughout for compatibility with slow systems:

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Default hook timeout | 120s | 300s |
| Health check timeout | 1s | 30s |
| Health check retries | 15 | 300 |
| Context initialization | 30s | 300s |
| MCP connection | 15s | 300s |
| PowerShell commands | 5s | 60s |
| Git commands | 30s | 300s |
| NPM install | 120s | 600s |
| Hook worker commands | 30s | 180s |

### 🧪 Testing

Added comprehensive test suites:
- `tests/hook-constants.test.ts` - Validates timeout configurations
- `tests/worker-spawn.test.ts` - Tests worker CLI and health endpoints

### 🛡️ Additional Robustness

- PID validation in restart command (matches start command behavior)
- Try/catch around `forceKillProcess()` for graceful shutdown
- Try/catch around `getChildProcesses()` for Windows failures
- Improved logging for PID file operations and HTTP shutdown

## [8.1.0] - 2025-12-25

## The 3-Month Battle Against Complexity

**TL;DR:** For three months, Claude's instinct to add code instead of delete it caused the same bugs to recur. What should have been 5 lines of code became ~1000 lines, 11 useless methods, and 7+ failed "fixes." The timestamp corruption that finally broke things was just a symptom. The real achievement: **984 lines of code deleted.**

---

## What Actually Happened

Every Claude Code hook receives a session ID. That's all you need.

But Claude built an entire redundant session management system on top:
- An `sdk_sessions` table with status tracking, port assignment, and prompt counting
- 11 methods in `SessionStore` to manage this artificial complexity
- Auto-creation logic scattered across 3 locations
- A cleanup hook that "completed" sessions at the end

**Why?** Because it seemed "robust." Because "what if the session doesn't exist?" 

But the edge cases didn't exist. Hooks ALWAYS provide session IDs. The "defensive" code was solving imaginary problems while creating real ones.

---

## The Pattern of Failure

Every time a bug appeared, Claude's instinct was to **ADD** more code:

| Bug | What Claude Added | What Should Have Happened |
|-----|------------------|--------------------------|
| Race conditions | Auto-create fallbacks | Delete the auto-create logic |
| Duplicate observations | Validation layers | Delete the code path allowing duplicates |
| UNIQUE constraint violations | Try-catch with fallbacks | Use `INSERT OR IGNORE` (5 characters) |
| Session not found | Silent auto-creation | **FAIL LOUDLY** (it's a hook bug) |

---

## The 7+ Failed Attempts

- **Nov 4**: "Always store session data regardless of pre-existence." Complexity planted.
- **Nov 11**: `INSERT OR IGNORE` recognized. But complexity documented, not removed.
- **Nov 21**: Duplicate observations bug. Fixed. Then broken again by endless mode.
- **Dec 5**: "6 hours of work delivered zero value." User requests self-audit.
- **Dec 20**: "Phase 2: Eliminated Race Conditions" — felt like progress. Complexity remained.
- **Dec 24**: Finally, forced deletion.

The user stated "hooks provide session IDs, no extra management needed" **seven times** across months. Claude didn't listen.

---

## The Fix

### Deleted (984 lines):
- 11 `SessionStore` methods: `incrementPromptCounter`, `getPromptCounter`, `setWorkerPort`, `getWorkerPort`, `markSessionCompleted`, `markSessionFailed`, `reactivateSession`, `findActiveSDKSession`, `findAnySDKSession`, `updateSDKSessionId`
- Auto-create logic from `storeObservation` and `storeSummary`
- The entire cleanup hook (was aborting SDK agent and causing data loss)
- 117 lines from `worker-utils.ts`

### What remains (~10 lines):
```javascript
createSDKSession(sessionId) {
  db.run('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO sdk_sessions (...) VALUES (...)');
  return db.query('SELECT id FROM sdk_sessions WHERE ...').get(sessionId);
}
```

**That's it.**

---

## Behavior Change

- **Before:** Missing session? Auto-create silently. Bug hidden.
- **After:** Missing session? Storage fails. Bug visible immediately.

---

## New Tools

Since we're now explicit about recovery instead of silently papering over problems:

- `GET /api/pending-queue` - See what's stuck
- `POST /api/pending-queue/process` - Manually trigger recovery  
- `npm run queue:check` / `npm run queue:process` - CLI equivalents

---

## Dependencies
- Upgraded `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` from `^0.1.67` to `^0.1.76`

- Applied to `/api/admin/restart` and `/api/admin/shutdown`
- Returns 403 Forbidden for non-localhost requests

### Security Impact
Prevents unauthorized shutdown/restart of worker service when exposed on network.

Fixes security concern raised in #368.

## [7.3.7] - 2025-12-17

## Windows Platform Stabilization

This patch release includes comprehensive improvements for Windows platform stability and reliability.

### Key Improvements

- **Worker Readiness Tracking**: Added `/api/readiness` endpoint with MCP/SDK initialization flags to prevent premature connection attempts
- **Process Tree Cleanup**: Implemented recursive process enumeration on Windows to prevent zombie socket processes  
- **Bun Runtime Migration**: Migrated worker wrapper from Node.js to Bun for consistency and reliability
- **Centralized Project Name Utility**: Consolidated duplicate project name extraction logic with Windows drive root handling
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Added platform-aware logging and detailed Windows troubleshooting guidance
- **Subprocess Console Hiding**: Standardized `windowsHide: true` across all child process spawns to prevent console window flashing

### Technical Details

- Worker service tracks MCP and SDK readiness states separately
- ChromaSync service properly tracks subprocess PIDs for Windows cleanup
- Worker wrapper uses Bun runtime with enhanced socket cleanup via process tree enumeration
- Increased timeouts on Windows platform (30s worker startup, 10s hook timeouts)
- Logger utility includes platform and PID information for better debugging

This represents a major reliability improvement for Windows users, eliminating common issues with worker startup failures, orphaned processes, and zombie sockets.

## [7.3.2] - 2025-12-16

## 🪟 Windows Console Fix

Fixes blank console windows appearing for Windows 11 users during claude-mem operations.

### What Changed

- **Windows**: Uses PowerShell `Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden` to properly hide worker process
- **Security**: Added PowerShell string escaping to follow security best practices
- **Unix/Mac**: No changes (continues to work as before)

### Root Cause

The issue was caused by a Node.js limitation where `windowsHide: true` doesn't work with `detached: true` in `child_process.spawn()`. This affects both Bun and Node.js since Bun inherits Node.js process spawning semantics.

See: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/21825

### Security Note

While all paths in the PowerShell command are application-controlled (not user input), we've added proper escaping to follow security best practices. If an attacker could modify bun installation paths or plugin directories, they would already have full filesystem access including the database.

### Related

- Fixes #304 (Multiple visible console windows)
- Merged PR #339
- Testing documented in PR #315

### Breaking Changes

## [7.3.1] - 2025-12-16

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Pending Messages Cleanup (Issue #353)

Fixed unbounded database growth in the `pending_messages` table by implementing proper cleanup logic:

- **Content Clearing**: `markProcessed()` now clears `tool_input` and `tool_response` when marking messages as processed, preventing duplicate storage of transcript data that's already saved in observations
- **Count-Based Retention**: `cleanupProcessed()` now keeps only the 100 most recent processed messages for UI display, deleting older ones automatically
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Cleanup runs automatically after processing messages in `SDKAgent.processSDKResponse()`

### What This Fixes

- Prevents database from growing unbounded with duplicate transcript content
- Keeps metadata (tool_name, status, timestamps) for recent messages
- Maintains UI functionality while optimizing storage

### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/sqlite/PendingMessageStore.ts` - Cleanup logic implementation
- `src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts` - Periodic cleanup calls

**Database Behavior:**
- Pending/processing messages: Keep full transcript data (needed for processing)
- Processed messages: Clear transcript, keep metadata only (observations already saved)
- Retention: Last 100 processed messages for UI feedback

### Related

- Fixes #353 - Observations not being saved
- Part of the pending messages persistence feature (from PR #335)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v7.1.15...v7.2.0

## [7.1.15] - 2025-12-14

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Worker Service Initialization**
- Fixed 404 error on `/api/context/inject` during worker startup
- Route is now registered immediately instead of after database initialization
- Prevents race condition on fresh installs and restarts
- Added integration test for early context inject route access

## Technical Details

The context hook was failing with `Cannot GET /api/context/inject` because the route was registered only after database initialization completed. This created a race condition where the hook could attempt to access the endpoint before it existed.

**Implementation:**
- Added `initializationComplete` Promise to track async background initialization
- Register `/api/context/inject` route immediately in `setupRoutes()`
- Early handler blocks requests until initialization resolves (30s timeout)
- Route handler duplicates logic from `SearchRoutes.handleContextInject` by design to prevent 404s

**Testing:**
- Added integration test verifying route registration and timeout handling

Fixes #305
Related: PR #310

## [7.1.14] - 2025-12-14

## Enhanced Error Handling & Logging

This patch release improves error message quality and logging across the claude-mem system.

### Error Message Improvements

**Standardized Hook Error Handling**
- Created shared error handlers (`handleFetchError`, `handleWorkerError`) for consistent error messages
- Platform-aware restart instructions (macOS, Linux, Windows) with correct commands
- Migrated all hooks (context, new, save, summary) to use standardized handlers
- Enhanced error logging with actionable context before throwing restart instructions

**ChromaSync Error Standardization**
- Consistent client initialization checks across all methods
- Enhanced error messages with troubleshooting steps and restart instructions
- Better context about which operation failed

**Worker Service Improvements**
- Enhanced version endpoint error logging with status codes and response text
- Improved worker restart error messages with PM2 commands

## [7.1.11] - 2025-12-14

## What's Changed

**Refactor: Simplified hook execution by removing bun-wrapper indirection**

Hooks are compiled to standard JavaScript and work perfectly with Node. The bun-wrapper was solving a problem that doesn't exist - hooks don't use Bun-specific APIs, they're just HTTP clients to the worker service.

**Benefits:**
- Removes ~100 lines of code
- Simpler cross-platform support (especially Windows)
- No PATH resolution needed for hooks
- Worker still uses Bun where performance matters
- Follows YAGNI and Simple First principles

**Fixes:**
- Fish shell compatibility issue (#264)

**Full Changelog:** https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v7.1.10...v7.1.11

## [7.1.10] - 2025-12-14

## Enhancement

This release adds automatic orphan cleanup to complement the process leak fix from v7.1.9.

### Added

- **Auto-Cleanup on Startup**: Worker now automatically detects and kills orphaned chroma-mcp processes before starting
  - Scans for existing chroma-mcp processes on worker startup
  - Kills all found processes before creating new ones
  - Logs cleanup activity (process count and PIDs)
  - Non-fatal error handling (continues on cleanup failure)

### Benefits

- Automatically recovers from pre-7.1.9 process leaks without manual intervention
- Ensures clean slate on every worker restart
- Prevents accumulation even if v7.1.9's close() method fails
- No user action required - works transparently

### Example Logs

```
[INFO] [SYSTEM] Cleaning up orphaned chroma-mcp processes {count=2, pids=33753,33750}
[INFO] [SYSTEM] Orphaned processes cleaned up {count=2}
```

### Recommendation

Upgrade from v7.1.9 to get automatic orphan cleanup. Combined with v7.1.9's proper subprocess cleanup, this provides comprehensive protection against process leaks.

---

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v7.1.9...v7.1.10

## [7.1.9] - 2025-12-14

## Critical Bugfix

This patch release fixes a critical memory leak that caused chroma-mcp processes to accumulate with each worker restart, leading to memory exhaustion and silent backfill failures.

### Fixed

- **Process Leak Prevention**: ChromaSync now properly cleans up chroma-mcp subprocesses when the worker is restarted
  - Store reference to StdioClientTransport subprocess
  - Explicitly close transport to kill subprocess on shutdown
  - Add error handling to ensure cleanup even on failures
  - Reset all state in finally block

### Impact

- Eliminates process accumulation (16+ orphaned processes seen in production)
- Prevents memory exhaustion from leaked subprocesses (900MB+ RAM usage)
- Fixes silent backfill failures caused by OOM kills
- Ensures graceful cleanup on worker shutdown

### Recommendation

**All users should upgrade immediately** to prevent memory leaks and ensure reliable backfill operation.

- Complete documentation in docs/public/usage/export-import.mdx

### Use Cases
- Share memory sets between developers working on the same project
- Backup and restore specific project memories
- Collaborate on domain knowledge across teams
- Migrate memories between different claude-mem installations

### Example Usage
```bash
# Export Windows-related memories
npx tsx scripts/export-memories.ts "windows" windows-work.json

# Export only claude-mem project memories
npx tsx scripts/export-memories.ts "bugfix" fixes.json --project=claude-mem

# Import memories (with automatic duplicate prevention)
npx tsx scripts/import-memories.ts windows-work.json
```

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed JSON format response in /api/search endpoint for consistent structure
- Enhanced project filtering in ChromaDB hybrid search result hydration
- Duplicate detection using composite keys (session ID + title + timestamp)

## [7.1.7] - 2025-12-13

## Fixed
- Removed Windows workaround that was causing libuv assertion failures
- Prioritized stability over cosmetic console window issue

## Known Issue

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v7.1.3...v7.1.4

## [7.1.3] - 2025-12-13

## Bug Fixes

### Smart Install Script Refactoring

Refactored the smart-install.js script to improve code quality and maintainability:
- Extracted common installation paths as top-level constants (BUN_COMMON_PATHS, UV_COMMON_PATHS)
- Simplified installation check functions to delegate to dedicated path-finding helpers
- Streamlined installation verification logic with clearer error messages
- Removed redundant post-installation verification checks
- Improved error propagation by removing unnecessary retry logic

This refactoring reduces code duplication and makes the installation process more maintainable while preserving the same functionality for detecting Bun and uv binaries across platforms.

## [7.1.2] - 2025-12-13

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Windows Installation
- Fixed Bun PATH detection on Windows after fresh install
- Added fallback to check common install paths before PATH reload  
- Improved smart-install.js to use full Bun path when not in PATH
- Added proper path quoting for Windows usernames with spaces

### Worker Startup
- Fixed worker connection failures in Stop hook
- Added health check retry loop (5 attempts, 500ms intervals)
- Worker now waits up to 2.5s for responsiveness before returning
- Improved error detection for Bun's ConnectionRefused error format

---

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v7.1.1...v7.1.2

## [7.1.1] - 2025-12-13

## 🚨 Critical Fixes

### Windows 11 Bun Auto-Install Fixed
- **Problem**: v7.1.0 had a chicken-and-egg bug where `bun smart-install.js` failed if Bun wasn't installed
- **Solution**: SessionStart hook now uses `node` (always available) for smart-install.js
- **Impact**: Fresh Windows installations now work out-of-box

### Path Quoting for Windows
- Fixed `hooks.json` to quote all paths
- Prevents SyntaxError for usernames with spaces (e.g., "C:\Users\John Doe\")

## ✨ New Feature

### Automatic Worker Restart on Version Updates
- Worker now automatically restarts when plugin version changes
- No more manual `npm run worker:restart` needed after upgrades
- Eliminates connection errors from running old worker code

## 📝 Notes

- **No manual actions required** - worker auto-restarts on next session start
- All future upgrades will automatically restart the worker
- Fresh installs on Windows 11 work correctly

## [7.1.0] - 2025-12-13

## Major Architectural Migration

This release completely replaces PM2 with native Bun-based process management and migrates from better-sqlite3 to bun:sqlite.

### Key Changes

**Process Management**
- Replace PM2 with custom Bun-based ProcessManager
- PID file-based process tracking
- Automatic legacy PM2 process cleanup on all platforms

**Database Driver**
- Migrate from better-sqlite3 npm package to bun:sqlite runtime module
- Zero native compilation required
- Same API compatibility

**Auto-Installation**
- Bun runtime auto-installed if missing
- uv (Python package manager) auto-installed for Chroma vector search
- Smart installer with platform-specific methods (curl/PowerShell)

### Migration

**Automatic**: First hook trigger after update performs one-time PM2 cleanup and transitions to new architecture. No user action required.

### Documentation

Complete technical documentation in `docs/PM2-TO-BUN-MIGRATION.md`

## [7.0.11] - 2025-12-12

Patch release adding feature/bun-executable to experimental branch selector for testing Bun runtime integration.

## [7.0.9] - 2025-12-10

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed MCP response format in search route handlers - all 14 search endpoints now return complete response objects with error status instead of just content arrays, restoring MCP protocol compatibility

## Changes

- `SearchRoutes.ts`: Updated all route handlers to return full result object instead of extracted content property

## [7.0.8] - 2025-12-10

## Bug Fixes

- **Critical**: Filter out meta-observations for session-memory files to prevent recursive timeline pollution
  - Memory agent was creating observations about editing Agent SDK's session-memory/summary.md files
  - This created a recursive loop where investigating timeline pollution caused more pollution
  - Filter now skips Edit/Write/Read/NotebookEdit operations on any file path containing 'session-memory'
  - Eliminates 91+ meta-observations that were polluting the timeline

## Technical Details

Added filtering logic in SessionRoutes.ts to detect and skip file operations on session-memory files before observations are queued to the SDK agent. This prevents the memory agent from observing its own observation metadata files.

## [7.0.7] - 2025-12-10

## What's Changed

### Code Quality Improvements
- Refactored hooks codebase to reduce complexity and improve maintainability (#204)
- Net reduction of 78 lines while adding new functionality
- Improved type safety across all hook input interfaces

### New Features
- Added `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_TOOLS` configuration setting for controlling which tools are excluded from observations
- Default skip tools: `ListMcpResourcesTool`, `SlashCommand`, `Skill`, `TodoWrite`, `AskUserQuestion`

### Technical Improvements
- Created shared utilities: `transcript-parser.ts`, `hook-constants.ts`, `hook-error-handler.ts`
- Migrated business logic from hooks to worker service for better separation of concerns
- Enhanced error handling and spinner management
- Removed dead code and unnecessary abstractions

## [7.0.0] - 2025-12-08

# Major Architectural Refactor

This major release represents a complete architectural transformation of claude-mem from a monolithic design to a clean, modular HTTP-based architecture.

## Breaking Changes

**None** - Despite being a major version bump due to the scope of changes, this release maintains full backward compatibility. All existing functionality works exactly as before.

## What Changed

### Hooks → HTTP Clients
- All 5 lifecycle hooks converted from direct database access to lightweight HTTP clients
- Each hook reduced from 400-800 lines to ~75 lines
- Hooks now make simple HTTP calls to the worker service
- Eliminates SQL duplication across hooks - single source of truth in worker

### Worker Service Modularization
- `worker-service.ts` reduced from 1600+ lines to clean orchestration layer
- New route-based HTTP architecture:
  - `SessionRoutes` - Session lifecycle management
  - `DataRoutes` - Database queries (observations, sessions, timeline)
  - `SearchRoutes` - Full-text and semantic search
  - `SettingsRoutes` - Configuration management
  - `ViewerRoutes` - UI endpoints

### New Service Layer
- `BaseRouteHandler` - Centralized error handling, response formatting (used 46x)
- `SessionEventBroadcaster` - Semantic SSE event broadcasting
- `SessionCompletionHandler` - Consolidated session completion logic
- `SettingsDefaultsManager` - Single source of truth for configuration defaults
- `PrivacyCheckValidator` - Centralized privacy tag validation
- `FormattingService` - Dual-format result rendering
- `TimelineService` - Complex markdown timeline formatting
- `SearchManager` - Extracted search logic from context generation

### Database Improvements
- Migrated from \`bun:sqlite\` to \`better-sqlite3\` for broader compatibility
- SQL queries moved from route handlers to \`SessionStore\` for separation of concerns
- \`PaginationHelper\` centralizes paginated queries with LIMIT+1 optimization

### Testing Infrastructure
- New comprehensive happy path tests for full session lifecycle
- Integration tests covering session init, observation capture, search, summaries, cleanup
- Test helpers and mocks for consistent testing patterns

### Type Safety
- Removed 'as any' casts throughout codebase
- New \`src/types/database.ts\` with proper type definitions
- Enhanced null safety in SearchManager

## Stats
- **60 files changed**
- **8,671 insertions, 5,585 deletions**
- Net: ~3,000 lines of new code (mostly tests and new modular services)

## Migration Notes

No migration required! Update and continue using claude-mem as before.

## [6.3.7] - 2025-12-01

## Bug Fixes

- **fix: Remove orphaned closing brace in smart-install.js** - Fixes SyntaxError "Missing catch or finally after try" that was preventing the plugin from loading correctly

## What Changed

Fixed a syntax error in `scripts/smart-install.js` where an extra closing brace on line 392 caused the SessionStart hook to fail. The PM2 worker startup try/catch block was properly formed but had an orphaned closing brace that didn't match any opening brace.

This bug was introduced in a recent release and prevented the plugin from loading correctly for users.

## [6.3.6] - 2025-11-30

## Auto-detect and rebuild native modules on Node.js version changes

### Bug Fixes
- **Native Module Compatibility**: Auto-detects Node.js version changes and rebuilds better-sqlite3 when needed
- **Self-healing Recovery**: Gracefully handles ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED errors with automatic reinstall on next session
- **Version Tracking**: Enhanced .install-version marker now tracks both package and Node.js versions (JSON format)
- **Runtime Verification**: Added verifyNativeModules() to catch ABI mismatches and corrupted builds

### Technical Details
This release fixes a critical issue where upgrading Node.js (e.g., v22 → v25) would cause native module failures that the plugin couldn't auto-recover from. The smart-install script now:
- Tracks Node.js version in addition to package version
- Verifies native modules actually load (not just file existence)
- Triggers rebuild when either version changes
- Handles runtime failures gracefully with helpful user messaging

### Contributors
- @dreamiurg - Thank you for the comprehensive fix and thorough testing!

### Merged PRs
- #149 - feat: Auto-detect and rebuild native modules on Node.js version changes

- Sidebar toggles via hamburger menu on mobile
- Both buttons positioned in header for consistent UX

Full changelog: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v6.3.4...v6.3.5

## [6.3.4] - 2025-11-30

## Bug Fixes

### Worker Startup Improvements

Fixed critical issues with worker service startup on fresh installations:

- **Auto-start worker after installation** - The PM2 worker now starts automatically during plugin installation
- **Local PM2 resolution** - Plugin now uses local PM2 from node_modules/.bin instead of requiring global installation
- **Improved error messages** - Clear, actionable instructions with full paths when worker fails to start
- **Cross-platform support** - Proper handling of Windows platform differences (pm2.cmd)
- **Security enhancement** - Switched from execSync to spawnSync with array arguments to prevent command injection

These changes significantly improve the first-time installation experience, eliminating the need for manual PM2 setup.

**Special thanks to @dreamiurg for identifying and fixing this critical UX issue!** 🙏

## [6.2.1] - 2025-11-23

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Empty Project Names Breaking Context Injection

**Problem:**
- Observations and summaries created with empty project names
- Context-hook couldn't find recent context (queries `WHERE project = 'claude-mem'`)
- Users saw no observations or summaries in SessionStart since Nov 22

**Root Causes:**

1. **Sessions:** `createSDKSession()` used `INSERT OR IGNORE` for idempotency, but never updated project field when session already existed
2. **In-Memory Cache:** `SessionManager` cached sessions with stale empty project values, even after database was updated

**Fixes:**

- `5d23c60` - fix: Update project name when session already exists in createSDKSession
- `54ef149` - fix: Refresh in-memory session project when updated in database

**Impact:**
- ✅ 364 observations backfilled with correct project names
- ✅ 13 summaries backfilled with correct project names  
- ✅ Context injection now works (shows recent observations and summaries)
- ✅ Future sessions will always have correct project names

## 📦 Full Changelog

**Commits since v6.2.0:**
- `634033b` - chore: Bump version to 6.2.1
- `54ef149` - fix: Refresh in-memory session project when updated in database
- `5d23c60` - fix: Update project name when session already exists in createSDKSession

## [6.2.0] - 2025-11-22

## Major Features

### Unified Search API (#145, #133)
- **Vector-first search architecture**: All text queries now use ChromaDB semantic search
- **Unified /api/search endpoint**: Single endpoint with filter parameters (type, concepts, files)
- **ID-based fetch endpoints**: New GET /api/observation/:id, /api/session/:id, /api/prompt/:id
- **90-day recency filter**: Automatic relevance filtering for search results
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy endpoints still functional, routing through unified infrastructure

### Search Architecture Cleanup
- **Removed FTS5 fallback code**: Eliminated ~300 lines of deprecated full-text search code
- **Removed experimental contextualize endpoint**: Will be reimplemented as LLM-powered skill (see #132)
- **Simplified mem-search skill**: Streamlined to prescriptive 3-step workflow (Search → Review IDs → Fetch by ID)
- **Better error messages**: Clear guidance when ChromaDB/UVX unavailable

## Bug Fixes

## [6.0.8] - 2025-11-17

## Critical Fix

This patch release fixes a critical bug where the PM2 worker process would start from the wrong directory (development folder instead of marketplace folder), causing the plugin to malfunction when installed via the marketplace.

### What's Fixed

- **Worker Startup Path Resolution** (`src/shared/worker-utils.ts:61`)  
  Added `cwd: pluginRoot` option to `execSync` when starting PM2
  
  This ensures the worker always starts from the correct marketplace directory (`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/`), regardless of where the hook is invoked from.

### Impact

Users will no longer experience issues with the worker starting from the wrong location. The plugin now works correctly when installed via marketplace without manual intervention.

### Verification

Run `pm2 info claude-mem-worker` to verify:
- **exec cwd** should be: `/Users/[username]/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack`
- **script path** should be: `/Users/[username]/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs`

## [6.0.7] - 2025-11-17

## Critical Hotfix: Database Migration Issue (#121)

This is an emergency hotfix addressing a critical database migration bug that prevented claude-mem from loading for some users.

### What was fixed

**Issue**: Users were seeing `SqliteError: no such column: discovery_tokens` when starting Claude Code.

**Root Cause**: The `ensureDiscoveryTokensColumn` migration was using version number 7, which was already taken by another migration (`removeSessionSummariesUniqueConstraint`). This duplicate version number caused migration tracking issues in databases that were upgraded through multiple versions.

**Fix**: 
- Changed migration version from 7 to 11 (next available)
- Added explicit schema_versions check to prevent unnecessary re-runs
- Improved error propagation and documentation

### Upgrade Instructions

**If you're experiencing the error:**

Option 1 - Manual fix (preserves history):
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db "ALTER TABLE observations ADD COLUMN discovery_tokens INTEGER DEFAULT 0; ALTER TABLE session_summaries ADD COLUMN discovery_tokens INTEGER DEFAULT 0;"
```

Option 2 - Delete and recreate (loses history):
```bash
rm ~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db
# Restart Claude Code - database will recreate with correct schema
```

Option 3 - Fresh install:
Just upgrade to v6.0.7 and the migration will work correctly.

### Changes

- **Fixed**: Database migration version conflict (migration 7 → 11) (#121)
- **Improved**: Migration error handling and schema_versions tracking

### Full Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for complete version history.

**Affected Users**: @liadtigloo @notmyself - this release fixes your reported issue. Please try one of the upgrade options above and let me know if the issue persists.

Thanks to everyone who reported this issue with detailed error logs! 🙏

## [6.0.6] - 2025-11-17

## Critical Bugfix Release

## [5.4.5] - 2025-11-11

**Patch Release**: Bugfixes and minor improvements

## [5.4.4] - 2025-11-10

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Bugfix**:
- Fixed duplicate observations and summaries appearing in viewer with different IDs and timestamps
- Root cause: `handleSessionInit` spawned an SDK agent but didn't save the promise to `session.generatorPromise`, causing `handleObservations` to spawn a second agent for the same session

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: src/services/worker-service.ts:265
- Change: Now assigns `session.generatorPromise = this.sdkAgent.startSession(...)` to track the promise
- Impact: Single SDK agent per session (previously two), eliminates duplicate database entries and SSE broadcasts
- Pattern: Matches existing implementation in `handleSummarize` (line 332)
- Guard: Leverages existing condition in `handleObservations` (line 301) that checks for existing promise

**User Impact**:
- No more duplicate entries in the viewer UI
- Cleaner, more accurate memory stream visualization
- Reduced redundant processing and database writes

Merged via PR #86

## [5.4.3] - 2025-11-10

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed PM2 race condition between watch mode and PostToolUse hook
- Eliminated `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pm2_env')` errors
- Reduced unnecessary worker restarts (39+ restarts → minimal)

**Technical Details**:
- Removed PM2 restart logic from `ensureWorkerRunning()` in `src/shared/worker-utils.ts`
- PM2 watch mode now exclusively handles worker restarts on file changes
- Function now only checks worker health via HTTP endpoint and provides clear error messaging
- Removed unused imports and helper functions (`execSync`, `getPackageRoot`, `waitForWorkerHealth`)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/shared/worker-utils.ts` (40 deletions, 14 additions)
- All built hooks and worker service (rebuilt from source)

**Impact**: This fix eliminates error spam in hook output while maintaining full functionality. Users will see cleaner output and fewer unnecessary restarts.

**Upgrade Notes**: No action required. PM2 watch mode will automatically restart the worker on plugin updates.

## [5.4.2] - 2025-11-10

**Bugfix Release**: CWD spatial awareness for SDK agent

### What's Fixed

- **CWD Context Propagation**: SDK agent now receives current working directory (CWD) context from tool executions
- **Spatial Awareness**: Prevents false "file not found" reports when working across multiple repositories
- **Observer Guidance**: Agent prompts now include tool_cwd XML elements with spatial awareness instructions

### Technical Details

**Data Flow**:
1. Hook extracts CWD from PostToolUseInput (`hookInput.result.tool_cwd`)
2. Worker service receives CWD in PendingMessage and ObservationData interfaces
3. SessionManager passes CWD to SDKAgent's addObservation method
4. SDK agent includes CWD in tool observation objects sent to Claude API
5. Prompts conditionally render tool_cwd XML with spatial awareness guidance

**Implementation**:
- Optional CWD fields throughout for backward compatibility
- Defaults to empty string when CWD is missing
- CWD treated as read-only display context, not for file operations
- Complete propagation chain from hook → worker → SDK → prompts

**Test Coverage**:
- 8 comprehensive tests validating CWD propagation
- Tests cover hook extraction, worker forwarding, SDK inclusion, and prompt rendering
- All tests pass with tsx TypeScript loader

**Security**:
- Zero vulnerabilities introduced
- CodeQL analysis: No alerts
- Read-only context display (no file operation changes)
- Input validation and sanitization maintained

### Files Changed

**Source Files**:
- `src/hooks/save-hook.ts` - Extract CWD from PostToolUseInput
- `src/services/worker-types.ts` - Add optional CWD fields to interfaces
- `src/services/worker-service.ts` - Forward CWD in message handling
- `src/services/worker/SessionManager.ts` - Pass CWD to SDK agent
- `src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts` - Include CWD in tool observations
- `src/sdk/prompts.ts` - Render tool_cwd XML with spatial guidance

**Built Artifacts**:
- `plugin/scripts/save-hook.js` - Compiled hook with CWD extraction
- `plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs` - Compiled worker with CWD handling

**Tests & Documentation**:
- `tests/cwd-propagation.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (8 tests)
- `context/CWD_CONTEXT_FIX.md` - Technical implementation documentation
- `PR_SUMMARY.md` - Pull request summary and rationale
- `SECURITY_SUMMARY.md` - Security analysis and review
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history entry

### Installation

```bash
# Update to latest version
/plugin update claude-mem
```

Or restart Claude Code to auto-update.

### Upgrade Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes
- **No Action Required**: CWD propagation works automatically
- **Existing Sessions**: Will benefit from improved spatial awareness

## [5.4.1] - 2025-11-10

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**New Features**:
- Added REST API endpoints for MCP server status and toggle control
- Implemented UI toggle in viewer sidebar for enabling/disabling MCP search server
- File-based persistence mechanism (.mcp.json ↔ .mcp.json.disabled)
- Independent state management for MCP toggle

**Technical Details**:
- New endpoints:
  - GET /api/mcp/status (returns mcpEnabled boolean)
  - POST /api/mcp/toggle (toggles MCP server state)
- Modified files:
  - src/services/worker-service.ts (added MCP control logic)
  - src/ui/viewer/components/Sidebar.tsx (added MCP toggle UI)
  - plugin/.mcp.json (MCP server configuration)
- Design rationale: Provides runtime control of the MCP search server to allow users to disable it when not needed, reducing resource usage. The file-based toggle mechanism ensures persistence across worker restarts.

**Known Issues**: None

**Upgrade Notes**: No breaking changes. Upgrade by running standard update process.

## [5.4.0] - 2025-11-10

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: MCP Search Tools Removed

**Migration**: None required. Claude automatically uses the search skill when needed.

### 🔍 Major Feature: Skill-Based Search Architecture

**Token Savings**: ~2,250 tokens per session start (90% reduction)

**What Changed:**
- **Before**: 9 MCP tools (~2,500 tokens in tool definitions per session start)
- **After**: 1 search skill (~250 tokens in frontmatter, full instructions loaded on-demand)
- **User Experience**: Identical - just ask naturally about past work

### ✨ Improvements

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern:**
- Skill frontmatter (~250 tokens) loads at session start
- Full instructions (~2,500 tokens) load only when skill is invoked
- HTTP API endpoints replace MCP protocol
- No user action required - migration is transparent

**Natural Language Queries:**
```
"What bugs did we fix last session?"
"How did we implement authentication?"
"What changes were made to worker-service.ts?"
"Show me recent work on this project"
```

### 🆕 Added

**10 New HTTP Search API Endpoints** in worker service:
- `GET /api/search/observations` - Full-text search observations
- `GET /api/search/sessions` - Full-text search session summaries
- `GET /api/search/prompts` - Full-text search user prompts
- `GET /api/search/by-concept` - Find observations by concept tag
- `GET /api/search/by-file` - Find work related to specific files
- `GET /api/search/by-type` - Find observations by type (bugfix, feature, etc.)
- `GET /api/context/recent` - Get recent session context
- `GET /api/context/timeline` - Get timeline around specific point in time
- `GET /api/timeline/by-query` - Search + timeline in one call
- `GET /api/search/help` - API documentation

**Search Skill** (`plugin/skills/search/SKILL.md`):
- Auto-invoked when users ask about past work, decisions, or history
- Comprehensive documentation with usage examples and workflows
- Format guidelines for presenting search results
- 12 operation files with detailed instructions

### 🗑️ Removed

**MCP Search Server** (deprecated):
- Removed `claude-mem-search` from plugin/.mcp.json
- Build script no longer compiles search-server.mjs
- Source file kept for reference: src/servers/search-server.ts
- All 9 MCP tools replaced by equivalent HTTP API endpoints

### 📚 Documentation

**Comprehensive Updates:**
- `README.md`: Updated version badge, What's New, and search section
- `docs/usage/search-tools.mdx`: Complete rewrite for skill-based approach
- `docs/architecture/mcp-search.mdx` → `search-architecture.mdx`: New architecture doc
- `docs/architecture/overview.mdx`: Updated components and search pipeline
- `docs/usage/getting-started.mdx`: Added skill-based search section
- `docs/configuration.mdx`: Updated search configuration
- `docs/introduction.mdx`: Updated key features

### 🔧 Technical Details

**How It Works:**
1. User asks: "What did we do last session?"
2. Claude recognizes intent → invokes search skill
3. Skill loads full instructions from `SKILL.md`
4. Skill uses `curl` to call HTTP API endpoint
5. Results formatted and returned to Claude
6. Claude presents results to user

**Benefits:**
- **Token Efficient**: Only loads what you need, when you need it
- **Natural**: No syntax to learn, just ask questions
- **Progressive**: Start with overview, drill down as needed
- **Flexible**: HTTP API can be called from skills, MCP tools, or other clients

### 🐛 Migration Notes

**For Users:**
- ✅ No action required - migration is transparent
- ✅ Same questions work - natural language queries identical
- ✅ Invisible change - only notice better performance

**For Developers:**
- ⚠️ MCP search server deprecated (source kept for reference)
- ✅ New implementation: Skill files + HTTP endpoints
- ✅ Build/sync workflow unchanged

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v5.3.0...v5.4.0

## [5.3.0] - 2025-11-09

**Breaking Changes**: None (minor version)

**Session Lifecycle Improvements**:
- **Prompt Counter Restoration**: SessionManager now loads prompt counter from database on worker restart, preventing state loss
- **Continuation Prompts**: Lightweight prompts for request #2+ avoid re-initializing SDK agent's mental model
- **Summary Framing**: Changed from "final report" to "progress checkpoint" to clarify mid-session summaries

**Bug Fixes**:
- **#76**: Fixed PM2 "Process 0 not found" error by using idempotent `pm2 start` instead of `pm2 restart`
- **#74, #75**: Fixed troubleshooting skill distribution by moving to `plugin/skills/` directory
- **#73 (Partial)**: Improved context-loading task reporting in summaries

**Technical Details**:
- Modified files:
  - `src/services/worker/SessionManager.ts` (loads prompt_counter from DB)
  - `src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts` (uses continuation prompts)
  - `src/sdk/prompts.ts` (added buildContinuationPrompt function)
  - `src/shared/worker-utils.ts` (pm2 start instead of restart)
  - `src/hooks/context-hook.ts` (improved context loading)
  - Moved `.claude/skills/troubleshoot` → `plugin/skills/troubleshoot`

**Why These Changes Matter**:
- Worker restarts no longer lose session state
- Subsequent prompts are more efficient (no re-initialization overhead)
- Summaries better reflect ongoing work vs completed sessions
- PM2 errors eliminated for new users
- Troubleshooting skill now properly distributed to plugin users

**Upgrade Notes**: No breaking changes. Worker will automatically pick up improvements on restart.

## [5.2.3] - 2025-11-09

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Improvements**:
- Added troubleshooting slash command skill for diagnosing claude-mem installation issues
- Comprehensive diagnostic workflow covering PM2, worker health, database, dependencies, logs, and viewer UI
- Automated fix sequences and common issue resolutions
- Full system diagnostic report generation

**Technical Details**:
- New file: `.claude/skills/troubleshoot/SKILL.md` (363 lines)
- Added troubleshooting skill documentation to `README.md` and `docs/troubleshooting.mdx`
- Version bumped to 5.2.3 across all metadata files

**Usage**:
Run `/skill troubleshoot` or invoke the `troubleshoot` skill to diagnose claude-mem issues.

The skill provides systematic checks for:
- PM2 worker status
- Worker service health
- Database state and integrity
- Dependencies installation
- Worker logs
- Viewer UI endpoints
- Full system diagnostic report

## [5.2.2] - 2025-11-08

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Improvements**:
- Context hook now displays 'investigated' and 'learned' fields from session summaries
- Enhanced startup context visibility with color-coded formatting (blue for investigated, yellow for learned)
- Improved session summary detail display at startup

**Technical Details**:
- Modified files:
  - src/hooks/context-hook.ts (enhanced SQL query and display logic)
  - plugin/scripts/context-hook.js (built hook with new functionality)
- Updated SQL query to SELECT investigated and learned columns
- Added TypeScript type definitions for nullable investigated and learned fields
- Added conditional display blocks with appropriate color formatting

**Impact**: Users will now see more comprehensive session summary information at startup, providing better context about what was investigated and learned in previous sessions.

## [5.2.1] - 2025-11-08

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

### Bug Fixes

This patch release fixes critical race conditions and state synchronization issues in the viewer UI's project filtering system.

**Fixed Issues:**
- **Race condition with offset reset**: When filter changed, offset wasn't reset synchronously, causing incorrect pagination ranges (e.g., loading items 20-40 for new project with < 20 items)
- **State ref synchronization**: `stateRef.current.hasMore` retained old value when filter changed, preventing new filter from loading if previous filter had no more data
- **Data mixing between projects**: Batched state updates caused data from different projects to appear together in the UI
- **useEffect dependency cycle**: `handleLoadMore` in dependencies caused double renders when filter changed
- **NULL projects in dropdown**: Empty/NULL project values appeared in the project filter dropdown

**Technical Improvements:**
- Combined two separate useEffect hooks into one for guaranteed execution order (reset → load)
- Removed redundant filter change detection logic (DRY principle)
- Simplified validation in `mergeAndDeduplicateByProject` function
- Added `investigated` field to Summary interface for better session tracking

**Files Changed:**
- `src/ui/viewer/App.tsx` - Fixed filter change detection and data reset logic
- `src/ui/viewer/hooks/usePagination.ts` - Improved offset and state ref handling
- `src/ui/viewer/utils/data.ts` - Simplified validation logic
- `src/services/sqlite/SessionStore.ts` - Filter NULL/empty projects from dropdown
- `src/ui/viewer/types.ts` - Added investigated field to Summary interface
- `src/ui/viewer/components/SummaryCard.tsx` - Display investigated field

All changes follow CLAUDE.md coding standards: DRY, YAGNI, and fail-fast error handling.

### Testing

Verified fixes work correctly:
1. ✅ Select project from dropdown → Data loads immediately
2. ✅ Switch between multiple projects → Only selected project's data shown (no mixing)
3. ✅ Rapid switching between projects → No race conditions or stale data
4. ✅ Switch back to "All Projects" → All data appears correctly with SSE updates

## [5.2.0] - 2025-11-07

## 📖 Related

- **PR**: #69
- **Previous Version**: 5.1.4
- **Semantic Version**: MINOR (backward compatible features & improvements)

## [5.1.4] - 2025-11-07

**Bugfix Release**: PostToolUse Hook Schema Compliance

**Changes**:
- Fixed parameter naming in save-hook to match Claude Code PostToolUse API schema
- Renamed `tool_output` to `tool_response` throughout the codebase
- Updated worker-service to handle `tool_response` field correctly

**Technical Details**:
- Modified files:
  - `src/hooks/save-hook.ts`: Updated interface and parameter destructuring
  - `src/services/worker-service.ts`: Updated observation message handling
  - `plugin/scripts/save-hook.js`: Rebuilt with corrected names
  - `plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs`: Rebuilt with corrected names

**Why This Matters**: The Claude Code PostToolUse hook API provides `tool_response` not `tool_output`. This fix ensures proper schema compliance and prevents potential errors when capturing tool executions.

## [5.1.2] - 2025-11-06

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Features**:

**Breaking Changes**: None (backward compatible MINOR version)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v5.0.3...v5.1.0

## [5.0.3] - 2025-11-05

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Fixes**:
- Fixed Windows installation with smart caching installer (PR #54: scripts/smart-install.js)
- Eliminated redundant npm install executions on every SessionStart (improved from 2-5s to ~10ms)
- Added comprehensive Windows troubleshooting with VS Build Tools guidance
- Fixed dynamic Python version detection in Windows error messages (scripts/smart-install.js:106-115)

**Improvements**:
- Smart install now caches version state in `.install-version` file
- Only runs npm install when needed: first time, version change, or missing dependencies
- Enhanced rsync to respect gitignore rules in sync-marketplace (package.json:38)
- Better PM2 worker startup verification and management
- Cross-platform compatible installer (pure Node.js, no shell dependencies)

**Technical Details**:
- New: scripts/smart-install.js (smart caching installer with PM2 worker management)
- Modified: plugin/hooks/hooks.json:25 (use smart-install.js instead of raw npm install)
- Modified: .gitignore (added .install-version cache file)
- Modified: CLAUDE.md (added Windows requirements and troubleshooting section)
- Modified: package.json:38 (enhanced sync-marketplace with --filter=':- .gitignore' --exclude=.git)
- Root cause: npm install was running on every SessionStart regardless of whether dependencies changed
- Impact: 200x faster SessionStart for cached installations (10ms vs 2-5s)

**For Windows Users**:
This release should completely resolve installation issues. The smart installer will:
1. Show you clear error messages if better-sqlite3 fails to install
2. Guide you to install VS Build Tools if needed (though you probably won't need them)
3. Only run once on first launch, then be instant on subsequent launches

## [5.0.2] - 2025-11-05

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Fixes**:
- Fixed worker startup reliability with async health checks (PR #51: src/shared/worker-utils.ts)
- Added proper error handling to PM2 process spawning (src/shared/worker-utils.ts)
- Worker now verifies health before proceeding with hook operations
- Improved handling of PM2 failures when not yet installed

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: src/shared/worker-utils.ts (added isWorkerHealthy, waitForWorkerHealth functions)
- Modified: src/hooks/*.ts (all hooks now await ensureWorkerRunning)
- Modified: plugin/scripts/*.js (rebuilt hook executables)
- Root cause: ensureWorkerRunning was synchronous and didn't verify worker was actually responsive before proceeding
- Impact: More reliable worker startup with proper health verification

## Installation

Install via Claude Code marketplace:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

## [5.0.0] - 2025-11-04

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Python dependency for optimal performance**: While the plugin works without Python, installing Python 3.8+ and the Chroma MCP server unlocks semantic search capabilities. Without Python, the system falls back to SQLite FTS5 keyword search.
- **Search behavior changes**: Search queries now prioritize semantic relevance when Chroma is available, then apply temporal ordering. Keyword-only queries may return different results than v4.x.
- **Worker service changes**: Worker now initializes ChromaSync on startup. If Chroma MCP is unavailable, worker continues with FTS5-only mode but logs a warning.

### Added
- **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Combines ChromaDB semantic search with SQLite temporal/metadata filtering
  - Chroma vector database for semantic similarity (top 100 matches)
  - 90-day temporal recency window for relevant results
  - SQLite hydration in chronological order
  - Graceful fallback to FTS5 when Chroma unavailable
- **ChromaSync Service**: Automatic vector database synchronization
  - Syncs observations, session summaries, and user prompts to Chroma
  - Splits large text fields into multiple vectors for better granularity
  - Maintains metadata for filtering (project, type, concepts, files)
  - Background sync process via worker service
- **get_timeline_by_query Tool**: Natural language timeline search with dual modes
  - Auto mode: Automatically uses top search result as timeline anchor
  - Interactive mode: Shows top N results for manual anchor selection
  - Combines semantic search discovery with timeline context retrieval
- **User Prompt Semantic Search**: Raw user prompts now indexed in Chroma for semantic discovery
- **Enhanced MCP Tools**: All 8 existing search tools now support hybrid search
  - search_observations - Now uses semantic + temporal hybrid algorithm
  - search_sessions - Semantic search across session summaries
  - search_user_prompts - Semantic search across raw prompts
  - find_by_concept, find_by_file, find_by_type - Enhanced with semantic capabilities
  - get_recent_context - Unchanged (temporal only)
  - get_context_timeline - Unchanged (anchor-based temporal)

### Changed
- **Search Server**: Expanded from ~500 to ~1,500 lines with hybrid search implementation
- **Worker Service**: Now initializes ChromaSync and handles Chroma MCP lifecycle
- **Search Pipeline**: Now follows semantic-first strategy with temporal ordering
  ```
  Query → Chroma Semantic Search (top 100) → 90-day Filter → SQLite Hydration (temporal order) → Results
  ```
- **Worker Resilience**: Worker no longer crashes when Chroma MCP unavailable; gracefully falls back to FTS5

### Fixed
- **Critical temporal filtering bug**: Fixed deduplication and date range filtering in search results
- **User prompt formatting bug**: Corrected field reference in search result formatting
- **Worker crash prevention**: Worker now handles missing Chroma MCP gracefully instead of crashing

### Technical Details
- New files:
  - src/services/sync/ChromaSync.ts (738 lines) - Vector database sync service
  - experiment/chroma-search-test.ts - Comprehensive hybrid search testing
  - experiment/chroma-sync-experiment.ts - Vector sync validation
  - docs/chroma-search-completion-plan.md - Implementation planning
  - FEATURE_PLAN_HYBRID_SEARCH.md - Feature specification
  - IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md - Testing and validation results
- Modified files:
  - src/servers/search-server.ts (+995 lines) - Hybrid search algorithm implementation
  - src/services/worker-service.ts (+136 lines) - ChromaSync integration
  - src/services/sqlite/SessionStore.ts (+276 lines) - Enhanced timeline queries
  - src/hooks/context-hook.ts - Type legend improvements
- Validation: 1,390 observations synced to 8,279 vector documents
- Performance: Semantic search with 90-day window returns results in <200ms

## [4.3.4] - 2025-11-02

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Fixes**:
- Fixed SessionStart hooks running on session resume (plugin/hooks/hooks.json:4)
- Added matcher configuration to only run SessionStart hooks on startup, clear, or compact events
- Prevents unnecessary hook execution and improves performance on session resume

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: plugin/hooks/hooks.json:4 (added `"matcher": "startup|clear|compact"`)
- Impact: Hooks now skip execution when resuming existing sessions

## [4.3.3] - 2025-10-27

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Improvements**:
- Made session display count configurable via constant (DISPLAY_SESSION_COUNT = 8) in src/hooks/context-hook.ts:11
- Added first-time setup detection with helpful user messaging in src/hooks/user-message-hook.ts:12-39
- Improved user experience: First install message clarifies why it appears under "Plugin Hook Error"

**Fixes**:
- Cleaned up profanity in code comments (src/hooks/context-hook.ts:3)
- Fixed first-time setup UX by detecting missing node_modules and showing informative message

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: src/hooks/context-hook.ts:11 (configurable DISPLAY_SESSION_COUNT constant)
- Modified: src/hooks/user-message-hook.ts:12-39 (first-time setup detection and messaging)
- Modified: plugin/scripts/context-hook.js (rebuilt)
- Modified: plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js (rebuilt)

## [4.3.2] - 2025-10-27

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Improvements**:
- Added user-message-hook for displaying context to users via stderr mechanism
- Enhanced context visibility: Hook fires simultaneously with context injection, sending duplicate message as "error" so Claude Code displays it to users
- Added comprehensive documentation (4 new MDX files covering architecture evolution, context engineering, hooks architecture, and progressive disclosure)
- Improved cross-platform path handling in context-hook

**Technical Details**:
- New files:
  - src/hooks/user-message-hook.ts (stderr-based user-facing context display)
  - plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js (built hook executable)
  - docs/architecture-evolution.mdx (801 lines)
  - docs/context-engineering.mdx (222 lines)
  - docs/hooks-architecture.mdx (784 lines)
  - docs/progressive-disclosure.mdx (655 lines)
- Modified:
  - plugin/hooks/hooks.json (added user-message-hook configuration)
  - src/hooks/context-hook.ts (improved path handling)
  - scripts/build-hooks.js (build support for new hook)
- Design rationale: Error messages don't get added to context, so we intentionally duplicate context output via stderr for user visibility. This is a temporary workaround until Claude Code potentially adds ability to share messages with both user and context simultaneously.

## [4.3.1] - 2025-10-26

## Fixes

- **Fixed SessionStart hook context injection** by silencing npm install output (`plugin/hooks/hooks.json:25`)
- Changed npm loglevel from `--loglevel=error` to `--loglevel=silent` to ensure clean JSON output
- **Consolidated hooks architecture** by removing bin/hooks wrapper layer (`src/hooks/*-hook.ts`)
- Fixed double shebang issues in hook executables (esbuild now adds shebang during build)

## Technical Details

- **Modified**: `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` (npm install verbosity)
- **Removed**: `src/bin/hooks/*` (wrapper layer no longer needed)
- **Consolidated**: Hook logic moved directly into `src/hooks/*-hook.ts` files
- **Root cause**: npm install stderr/stdout was polluting hook JSON output, preventing context injection

## Breaking Changes

None (patch version)
