## How to add a new skill

1. Create a new directory: `skills/your-skill-name/`
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with required YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-skill-name
   description: >-
     Clear description of what this skill does and when
     an AI agent should activate it. Include keywords.
   domain: cybersecurity
   subdomain: [category]
   tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
   version: "1.0"
   author: your-github-username
   license: Apache-2.0
   ---
   ```
3. Write clear, step-by-step instructions in the Markdown body using these sections:
   - ## When to Use
   - ## Prerequisites
   - ## Workflow (numbered steps with real commands)
   - ## Key Concepts (table)
   - ## Tools & Systems
   - ## Common Scenarios
   - ## Output Format
4. (Optional) Add supporting files:
   - `references/standards.md` — Real standard numbers, CVE refs, NIST/MITRE links
   - `references/workflows.md` — Deep technical procedure
   - `scripts/process.py` — Real working helper script
   - `assets/template.md` — Real filled-in checklist/template
5. Submit a PR with title: `Add skill: your-skill-name`
